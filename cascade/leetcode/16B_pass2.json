More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n            For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].\n            Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].\n            While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.\n        Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.\n        The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: nums = [1,2,3]\n        Output: [1,3,2]\n        Example 2:\n        Input: nums = [3,2,1]\n        Output: [1,2,3]\n        Example 3:\n        Input: nums = [1,1,5]\n        Output: [1,5,1]\n        \"\"\"\n",

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\n        For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:\n        The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\n        Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\n        Custom Judge:\n        The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):\n            intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\n            listA - The first linked list.\n            listB - The second linked list.\n            skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n            skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n        The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program.

In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.\n            In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011\n        Output: 3\n        Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000\n        Output: 1\n        Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101\n        Output: 31\n        Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.\n        \"\"\"\n",
