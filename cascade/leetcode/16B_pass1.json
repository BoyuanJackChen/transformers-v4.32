Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n            If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range.

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\n        For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:\n        The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\n        Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\n        Custom Judge:\n        The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):\n            intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\n            listA - The first linked list.\n            listB - The second linked list.\n            skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n            skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n        The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\n        Output: Intersected at '8'\n        Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\n        From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5].

From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4].

From the head of B, it reads as [1,5].

        "prompt": "class Solution:\n    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.\n            For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.\n            In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.\n        A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.\n        Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]\n        Output: 6\n        Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).\n        Example 2:\n        Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]\n        Output: 7\n        Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.\n        One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).\n        Example 3:\n        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n        Output: 2\n        \"\"\"\n",

An example of one system is represented in the following picture:\n        Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.\n        In text form, it looks like this (with \u27f6 representing the tab character):\n        dir\n        \u27f6 subdir1\n        \u27f6 \u27f6 file1.ext\n        \u27f6 \u27f6 subsubdir1\n        \u27f6 subdir2\n        \u27f6 \u27f6 subsubdir2\n        \u27f6 \u27f6 \u27f6 file2.ext\n        If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\". Note that the '\\n' and '\\t' are the new-line and tab characters.\n        Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is \"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.\n        Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.\n        Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: input = \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tfile.ext\"\n        Output: 20\n        Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is \"dir/subdir2/file.ext\" of length 20.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: input = \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\"\n        Output: 32\n        Explanation: We have two files:\n        \"dir/subdir1/file1.ext\" of length 21\n        \"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\" of length 32.\n        We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: input = \"a\"\n        Output: 0\n        Explanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named \"a\".\n        \"\"\"\n",

We want to represent the grid with a Quad-Tree.\n        Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.\n        Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\n        A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n            val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\n            isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n        class Node {\n            public boolean val;\n            public boolean isLeaf;\n            public Node topLeft;\n            public Node topRight;\n            public Node bottomLeft;\n            public Node bottomRight;\n        }\n        We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n            If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n            If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\n            Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n        If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\n        Quad-Tree format:\n        The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n        It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\n        If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n        Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\n        Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:\n        Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\n        Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\n        Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.\n        The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.\n        The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.\n        Explanation is shown in the photo below:\n        \"\"\"\n",

Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n            A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n            A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\n            A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\n            A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n            A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\n            The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\n            CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\n        Output: true\n        Explanation: \n        The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \n        The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \n        Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\n        So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: code = \"<DIV>>> ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\n        Output: true\n        Explanation:\n        We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\n        start_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\n        end_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\n        tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\n        text1 -> \">> ![cdata[]] \"\n        cdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\n        text2 -> \"]]>>]\"\n        The reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\n        The reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\n        Output: false\n        Explanation: Unbalanced.

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called \"Ring Buffer\".\n        One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.\n        Implement the MyCircularQueue class:\n            MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.\n            int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n            int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n            boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\n            boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\n            boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.\n            boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.\n        You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language. \n        Example 1:\n        Input\n        [\"MyCircularQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"Rear\", \"isFull\", \"deQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"Rear\"]\n        [[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]\n        Output\n        [null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]\n        Explanation\n        MyCircularQueue myCircularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3);\n        myCircularQueue.enQueue(1); // return True\n        myCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True\n        myCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True\n        myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return False\n        myCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 3\n        myCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True\n        myCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True\n        myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True\n        myCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 4\n        \"\"\"\n",

Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.\n        Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n        You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n        A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\n        Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\n        Output: [3,4]\n        Explanation:\n        Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\n        Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\n        Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n        So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\n        Output: [8]\n        Explanation:\n        Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n        Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n        Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\n        Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n        Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n        So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\n        Output: [7,1]\n        Explanation:\n        Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n        Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n        Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\n        Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\n        Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\n        So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n        \"\"\"\n",

Each item has a price. However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.\n        You are given an integer array price where price[i] is the price of the ith item, and an integer array needs where needs[i] is the number of pieces of the ith item you want to buy.\n        You are also given an array special where special[i] is of size n + 1 where special[i][j] is the number of pieces of the jth item in the ith offer and special[i][n] (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the ith offer.\n        Return the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: price = [2,5], special = [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], needs = [3,2]\n        Output: 14\n        Explanation: There are two kinds of items, A and B.

For example, \"11106\" can be mapped into:\n            \"AAJF\" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)\n            \"KJF\" with the grouping (11 10 6)\n        Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because \"06\" cannot be mapped into 'F' since \"6\" is different from \"06\".\n        In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message \"1*\" may represent any of the encoded messages \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", or \"19\". Decoding \"1*\" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.\n        Given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it.\n        Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: s = \"*\"\n        Output: 9\n        Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", or \"9\".\n        Each of these can be decoded to the strings \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", and \"I\" respectively.\n        Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode \"*\".\n        Example 2:\n        Input: s = \"1*\"\n        Output: 18\n        Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", or \"19\".\n        Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. \"11\" can be decoded to \"AA\" or \"K\").\n        Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode \"1*\".\n        Example 3:\n        Input: s = \"2*\"\n        Output: 15\n        Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"25\", \"26\", \"27\", \"28\", or \"29\".\n        \"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"25\", and \"26\" have 2 ways of being decoded, but \"27\", \"28\", and \"29\" only have 1 way.\n        Hence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode \"2*\".\n        \"\"\"\n",

Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.\n        After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.\n        Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: positions = [[1,2],[2,3],[6,1]]\n        Output: [2,5,5]\n        Explanation:\n        After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2.\n        After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.\n        After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.\n        Thus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].\n        Example 2:\n        Input: positions = [[100,100],[200,100]]\n        Output: [100,100]\n        Explanation:\n        After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 100.\n        After the second drop, the tallest stack is either square 1 or square 2, both with heights of 100.\n        Thus, we return an answer of [100, 100].\n        Note that square 2 only brushes the right side of square 1, which does not count as landing on it.\n        \"\"\"\n",

        "prompt": "class Solution:\n    def removeComments(self, source: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\n        In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n            The string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n            The string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n        The first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n            For example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n            Similarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n        If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n        There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n            For example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n        Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n        It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n        Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\n        After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\n        Output: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\n        Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:\n        /*Test program */\n        int main()\n        { \n          // variable declaration \n        int a, b, c;\n        /* This is a test\n           multiline  \n           comment for \n           testing */\n        a = b + c;\n        }\n        The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\n        The line by line output code is visualized as below:\n        int main()\n        { \n        int a, b, c;\n        a = b + c;\n        }\n        Example 2:\n        Input: source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\n        Output: [\"ab\"]\n        Explanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n        \"\"\"\n",

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n            (An integer could be positive or negative.)\n            A let expression takes the form \"(let v1 e1 v2 e2... vn en expr)\", where let is always the string \"let\", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.\n            An add expression takes the form \"(add e1 e2)\" where add is always the string \"add\", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n            A mult expression takes the form \"(mult e1 e2)\" where mult is always the string \"mult\", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n            For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", and \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n            Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: expression = \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\"\n        Output: 14\n        Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\n        we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\n        Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: expression = \"(let x 3 x 2 x)\"\n        Output: 2\n        Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: expression = \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\"\n        Output: 5\n        Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\n        The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n        \"\"\"\n",

Ignore numbers and spaces in licensePlate, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in licensePlate, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.\n        For example, if licensePlate = \"aBc 12c\", then it contains letters 'a', 'b' (ignoring case), and 'c' twice. Possible completing words are \"abccdef\", \"caaacab\", and \"cbca\".\n        Return the shortest completing word in words. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in words.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: licensePlate = \"1s3 PSt\", words = [\"step\",\"steps\",\"stripe\",\"stepple\"]\n        Output: \"steps\"\n        Explanation: licensePlate contains letters's', 'p','s' (ignoring case), and 't'.\n        \"step\" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1's'.\n        \"steps\" contains 't', 'p', and both's' characters.\n        \"stripe\" is missing an's'.\n        \"stepple\" is missing an's'.\n        Since \"steps\" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: licensePlate = \"1s3 456\", words = [\"looks\",\"pest\",\"stew\",\"show\"]\n        Output: \"pest\"\n        Explanation: licensePlate only contains the letter's'.

Each glass holds one cup of champagne.\r\n        Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)\r\n        For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.\r\n        Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)\r\n        Example 1:\r\n        Input: poured = 1, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1\r\n        Output: 0.00000\r\n        Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)).

Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with an equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as possible.
