Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n            Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n            Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n            If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.\n            Return the integer as the final result.\n        Note:\n            Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.\n            Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: s = \"42\"\n        Output: 42\n        Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.\n        Step 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n                 ^\n        Step 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n                 ^\n        Step 3: \"42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n                   ^\n        The parsed integer is 42.\n        Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: s = \"   -42\"\n        Output: -42\n        Explanation:\n        Step 1: \"   -42\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)\n                    ^\n        Step 2: \"   -42\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)\n                     ^\n        Step 3: \"   -42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n                       ^\n        The parsed integer is -42.\n        Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: s = \"4193 with words\"\n        Output: 4193\n        Explanation:\n        Step 1: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n                 ^\n        Step 2: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n                 ^\n        Step 3: \"4193 with words\" (\"4193\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n                     ^\n        The parsed integer is 4193.\n        Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.\n        \"\"\"\n",

Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.\n        Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.\n        The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.\n        Your solution must use only constant extra space.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\n        Output: [1,2]\n        Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].\n        Example 2:\n        Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6\n        Output: [1,3]\n        Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6.

Guess 7.\n            - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.\n            - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.\n                - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.\n                - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n                - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n            - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.\n                - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.\n                - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.\n                    - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.\n                    - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n                    - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n                - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.\n                    - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n                    - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.\n        The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: n = 1\n        Output: 0\n        Explanation: There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: n = 2\n        Output: 1\n        Explanation: There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.\n        - Guess 1.\n            - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.\n        The worst case is that you pay $1.\n        \"\"\"\n",

The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.\n            For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.\n            In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.\n        A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.\n        Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]\n        Output: 6\n        Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).\n        Example 2:\n        Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]\n        Output: 7\n        Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.\n        One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).\n        Example 3:\n        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n        Output: 2\n        \"\"\"\n",

An example of one system is represented in the following picture:\n        Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.\n        In text form, it looks like this (with \u27f6 representing the tab character):\n        dir\n        \u27f6 subdir1\n        \u27f6 \u27f6 file1.ext\n        \u27f6 \u27f6 subsubdir1\n        \u27f6 subdir2\n        \u27f6 \u27f6 subsubdir2\n        \u27f6 \u27f6 \u27f6 file2.ext\n        If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\".

Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.\n        Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.\n        Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: nums = [1,5,2]\n        Output: false\n        Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. \n        If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). \n        So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. \n        Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]\n        Output: true\n        Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1.

        "question": "class Solution:\n    def isValid(self, code: str) -> bool:\n        \"\"\"\n        Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.\n        A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\n            The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n            A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n            A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\n            A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\n            A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n            A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\n            The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\n            CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\n        Output: true\n        Explanation: \n        The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \n        The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \n        Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\n        So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\n        Output: true\n        Explanation:\n        We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\n        start_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\n        end_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\n        tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\n        text1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\n        cdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\n        text2 -> \"]]>>]\"\n        The reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\n        The reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\n        Output: false\n        Explanation: Unbalanced.

Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.\n        Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n        You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n        A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\n        Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\n        Output: [3,4]\n        Explanation:\n        Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\n        Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\n        Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n        So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\n        Output: [8]\n        Explanation:\n        Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n        Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n        Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\n        Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n        Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n        So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\n        Output: [7,1]\n        Explanation:\n        Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n        Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n        Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\n        Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\n        Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\n        So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n        \"\"\"\n",

Decoding \"1*\" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.\n        Given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it.\n        Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: s = \"*\"\n        Output: 9\n        Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", or \"9\".\n        Each of these can be decoded to the strings \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", and \"I\" respectively.\n        Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode \"*\".\n        Example 2:\n        Input: s = \"1*\"\n        Output: 18\n        Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", or \"19\".\n        Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. \"11\" can be decoded to \"AA\" or \"K\").\n        Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode \"1*\".\n        Example 3:\n        Input: s = \"2*\"\n        Output: 15\n        Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"25\", \"26\", \"27\", \"28\", or \"29\".\n        \"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"25\", and \"26\" have 2 ways of being decoded, but \"27\", \"28\", and \"29\" only have 1 way.\n        Hence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode \"2*\".\n        \"\"\"\n",

        "question": "class Solution:\n    def removeComments(self, source: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\n        In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n            The string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n            The string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n        The first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n            For example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n            Similarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n        If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n        There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n            For example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n        Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n        It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n        Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\n        After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\n        Output: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\n        Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:\n        /*Test program */\n        int main()\n        { \n          // variable declaration \n        int a, b, c;\n        /* This is a test\n           multiline  \n           comment for \n           testing */\n        a = b + c;\n        }\n        The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\n        The line by line output code is visualized as below:\n        int main()\n        { \n        int a, b, c;\n        a = b + c;\n        }\n        Example 2:\n        Input: source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\n        Output: [\"ab\"]\n        Explanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n        \"\"\"\n",

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n            (An integer could be positive or negative.)\n            A let expression takes the form \"(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)\", where let is always the string \"let\", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.\n            An add expression takes the form \"(add e1 e2)\" where add is always the string \"add\", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n            A mult expression takes the form \"(mult e1 e2)\" where mult is always the string \"mult\", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n            For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", and \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n            Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: expression = \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\"\n        Output: 14\n        Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\n        we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\n        Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: expression = \"(let x 3 x 2 x)\"\n        Output: 2\n        Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: expression = \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\"\n        Output: 5\n        Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\n        The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n        \"\"\"\n",

If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in words.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: licensePlate = \"1s3 PSt\", words = [\"step\",\"steps\",\"stripe\",\"stepple\"]\n        Output: \"steps\"\n        Explanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.\n        \"step\" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.\n        \"steps\" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.\n        \"stripe\" is missing an 's'.\n        \"stepple\" is missing an 's'.\n        Since \"steps\" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: licensePlate = \"1s3 456\", words = [\"looks\",\"pest\",\"stew\",\"show\"]\n        Output: \"pest\"\n        Explanation: licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these \"pest\", \"stew\", and \"show\" are shortest. The answer is \"pest\" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.\n        \"\"\"\n",

Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like \"2x\" or \"-x\".\n        Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.\n            For example, expression = \"1 + 2 * 3\" has an answer of [\"7\"].\n        The format of the output is as follows:\n            For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.\n                For example, we would never write a term like \"b*a*c\", only \"a*b*c\".\n            Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.\n                For example, \"a*a*b*c\" has degree 4.\n            The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.\n            An example of a well-formatted answer is [\"-2*a*a*a\", \"3*a*a*b\", \"3*b*b\", \"4*a\", \"5*c\", \"-6\"].\n            Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.\n                For example, an expression of \"0\" has an output of [].\n        Note: You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].\n        Example 1:\n        Input: expression = \"e + 8 - a + 5\", evalvars = [\"e\"], evalints = [1]\n        Output: [\"-1*a\",\"14\"]\n        Example 2:\n        Input: expression = \"e - 8 + temperature - pressure\", evalvars = [\"e\", \"temperature\"], evalints = [1, 12]\n        Output: [\"-1*pressure\",\"5\"]\n        Example 3:\n        Input: expression = \"(e + 8) * (e - 8)\", evalvars = [], evalints = []\n        Output: [\"1*e*e\",\"-64\"]\n        \"\"\"\n",

The resulting grid is:\n        [[1,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,0,0]]\n        Hence the result is [2].\n        Example 2:\n        Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]], hits = [[1,1],[1,0]]\n        Output: [0,0]\n        Explanation: Starting with the grid:\n        [[1,0,0,0],\n         [1,1,0,0]]\n        We erase the underlined brick at (1,1), resulting in the grid:\n        [[1,0,0,0],\n         [1,0,0,0]]\n        All remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall. The grid remains the same:\n        [[1,0,0,0],\n         [1,0,0,0]]\n        Next, we erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:\n        [[1,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,0,0]]\n        Once again, all remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall.\n        Hence the result is [0,0].\n        \"\"\"\n",

Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\n        For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n        Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\n        You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n).

The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: n = 1\n        Output: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]\n        Explanation:\n        n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.\n        The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:\n        output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)\n        - a is the id of a philosopher.\n        - b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.\n        - c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.\n        \"\"\"\n",

If there are still movements to play return \"Pending\".\n        You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]\n        Output: \"A\"\n        Explanation: A wins, they always play first.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]\n        Output: \"B\"\n        Explanation: B wins.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]\n        Output: \"Draw\"\n        Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.\n        \"\"\"\n",

The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666. \n        Example 2:\n        Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 1, target = 7\n        Output: 0.3333333333333333\n        Explanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 = 0.3333333333333333 probability to the vertex 7 after second 1. \n        \"\"\"\n",

The score of each player is 0 initially.\n        The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.\n        Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.\n        Return \"Alice\" if Alice will win, \"Bob\" if Bob will win, or \"Tie\" if they will end the game with the same score.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: values = [1,2,3,7]\n        Output: \"Bob\"\n        Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]\n        Output: \"Alice\"\n        Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.\n        If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.\n        If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.\n        Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: values = [1,2,3,6]\n        Output: \"Tie\"\n        Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.\n        \"\"\"\n",

If we choose \"adefadda\", we are left with \"ccc\" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose \"ef\" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"] which gives us 3 substrings.

        "question": "class Solution:\n    def getLengthOfOptimalCompression(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string \"aabccc\" we replace \"aa\" by \"a2\" and replace \"ccc\" by \"c3\". Thus the compressed string becomes \"a2bc3\".\n        Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.\n        Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.\n        Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: s = \"aaabcccd\", k = 2\n        Output: 4\n        Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us \"a3bc3d\" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = \"abcccd\" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be \"a3c3\" of length 4.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 2\n        Output: 2\n        Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be \"a4\" of length 2.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: s = \"aaaaaaaaaaa\", k = 0\n        Output: 3\n        Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything.

For example, a stick of length 6 is labelled as follows:\n        Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at.\n        You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.\n        The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.\n        Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]\n        Output: 16\n        Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:\n        The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.\n        Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).\n        Example 2:\n        Input: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]\n        Output: 22\n        Explanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.\n        There are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.\n        \"\"\"\n",

Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.\n        Successor(x, curOrder):\n            if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:\n                if x is the king return null\n                else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)\n            else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder\n        For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.\n            In the beginning, curOrder will be [\"king\"].\n            Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\"].\n            Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"].\n            Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"].\n            Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"].\n        Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.\n        Implement the ThroneInheritance class:\n            ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class.

(i.e. there is some path between them).\n        Return an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]\n        Output: [false,false,true]\n        Explanation: The divisors for each number:\n        1:   1\n        2:   1, 2\n        3:   1, 3\n        4:   1, 2, 4\n        5:   1, 5\n        6:   1, 2, 3, 6\n        Using the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the\n        only ones directly connected. The result of each query:\n        [1,4]   1 is not connected to 4\n        [2,5]   2 is not connected to 5\n        [3,6]   3 is connected to 6 through path 3--6\n        Example 2:\n        Input: n = 6, threshold = 0, queries = [[4,5],[3,4],[3,2],[2,6],[1,3]]\n        Output: [true,true,true,true,true]\n        Explanation: The divisors for each number are the same as the previous example. However, since the threshold is 0,\n        all divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.\n        Example 3:\n        Input: n = 5, threshold = 1, queries = [[4,5],[4,5],[3,2],[2,3],[3,4]]\n        Output: [false,false,false,false,false]\n        Explanation: Only cities 2 and 4 share a common divisor 2 which is strictly greater than the threshold 1, so they are the only ones directly connected.\n        Please notice that there can be multiple queries for the same pair of nodes [x, y], and that the query [x, y] is equivalent to the query [y, x].\n        \"\"\"\n",

The orderTypei is:\r\n            0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or\r\n            1 if it is a batch of sell orders.\r\n        Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.\r\n        There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed.

There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.\r\n        - 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.\r\n        - 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.\r\n        - 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.\r\n        Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.\r\n        Example 2:\r\n        Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]\r\n        Output: 999999984\r\n        Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:\r\n        - 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.\r\n        - 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.\r\n        - 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.\r\n        - 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.\r\n        Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5.

The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.\n            For example, folders \"/a\" and \"/b\" in the file structure below are identical.

You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.\n            Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.\n            Upgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:\n                The node is unlocked,\n                It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and\n                It does not have any locked ancestors.\n        Implement the LockingTree class:\n            LockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.\n            lock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user.\n            unlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to unlock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become unlocked.\n            upgrade(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to upgrade the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will be upgraded.\n        Example 1:\n        Input\n        [\"LockingTree\", \"lock\", \"unlock\", \"unlock\", \"lock\", \"upgrade\", \"lock\"]\n        [[[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2], [4, 5], [0, 1], [0, 1]]\n        Output\n        [null, true, false, true, true, true, false]\n        Explanation\n        LockingTree lockingTree = new LockingTree([-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);\n        lockingTree.lock(2, 2);    // return true because node 2 is unlocked.\n                                   // Node 2 will now be locked by user 2.\n        lockingTree.unlock(2, 3);  // return false because user 3 cannot unlock a node locked by user 2.\n        lockingTree.unlock(2, 2);  // return true because node 2 was previously locked by user 2.\n                                   // Node 2 will now be unlocked.\n        lockingTree.lock(4, 5);    // return true because node 4 is unlocked.\n                                   // Node 4 will now be locked by user 5.\n        lockingTree.upgrade(0, 1); // return true because node 0 is unlocked and has at least one locked descendant (node 4).\n                                   // Node 0 will now be locked by user 1 and node 4 will now be unlocked.\n        lockingTree.lock(0, 1);    // return false because node 0 is already locked.\n        \"\"\"\n",

You are further given two 0-indexed integer arrays: rowCosts of length m and colCosts of length n.\n            If the robot moves up or down into a cell whose row is r, then this move costs rowCosts[r].\n            If the robot moves left or right into a cell whose column is c, then this move costs colCosts[c].\n        Return the minimum total cost for this robot to return home.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: startPos = [1, 0], homePos = [2, 3], rowCosts = [5, 4, 3], colCosts = [8, 2, 6, 7]\n        Output: 18\n        Explanation: One optimal path is that:\n        Starting from (1, 0)\n        -> It goes down to (2, 0). This move costs rowCosts[2] = 3.\n        -> It goes right to (2, 1). This move costs colCosts[1] = 2.\n        -> It goes right to (2, 2). This move costs colCosts[2] = 6.\n        -> It goes right to (2, 3). This move costs colCosts[3] = 7.\n        The total cost is 3 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 18\n        Example 2:\n        Input: startPos = [0, 0], homePos = [0, 0], rowCosts = [5], colCosts = [26]\n        Output: 0\n        Explanation: The robot is already at its home. Since no moves occur, the total cost is 0.\n        \"\"\"\n",

Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\n        Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:\n            Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.\n                For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.\n            Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.\n                For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.\n            Finally, represent the product as a string \"<pre>...<suf>eC\".\n                For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as \"12345...89876e5\".\n        Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\n        Example 1:\n        Input: left = 1, right = 4\n        Output: \"24e0\"\n        Explanation: The product is 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 24.\n        There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with \"e0\".\n        Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.\n        Thus, the final representation is \"24e0\".\n        Example 2:\n        Input: left = 2, right = 11\n        Output: \"399168e2\"\n        Explanation: The product is 39916800.\n        There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with \"e2\".\n        The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further.\n        Hence, the abbreviated product is \"399168e2\".\n        Example 3:\n        Input: left = 371, right = 375\n        Output: \"7219856259e3\"\n        Explanation: The product is 7219856259000.\n        \"\"\"\n",

You are given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.\n        There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:\n            The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.\n            For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.\n        Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.\n        Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: bank = [\"011001\",\"000000\",\"010100\",\"001000\"]\n        Output: 8\n        Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam.

Each character can be a part of exactly one group.\n            For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.\n        Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.\n        Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: s = \"abcdefghi\", k = 3, fill = \"x\"\n        Output: [\"abc\",\"def\",\"ghi\"]\n        Explanation:\n        The first 3 characters \"abc\" form the first group.\n        The next 3 characters \"def\" form the second group.\n        The last 3 characters \"ghi\" form the third group.\n        Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.\n        Thus, the groups formed are \"abc\", \"def\", and \"ghi\".\n        Example 2:\n        Input: s = \"abcdefghij\", k = 3, fill = \"x\"\n        Output: [\"abc\",\"def\",\"ghi\",\"jxx\"]\n        Explanation:\n        Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups \"abc\", \"def\", and \"ghi\".\n        For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string.

Note that finalSum cannot be split into (2 + 2 + 4 + 4) as all the numbers should be unique.\n        Return a list of integers that represent a valid split containing a maximum number of integers. If no valid split exists for finalSum, return an empty list. You may return the integers in any order.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: finalSum = 12\n        Output: [2,4,6]\n        Explanation: The following are valid splits: (12), (2 + 10), (2 + 4 + 6), and (4 + 8).\n        (2 + 4 + 6) has the maximum number of integers, which is 3.

You should find that string.\n        Return the string in words that has different difference integer array.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: words = [\"adc\",\"wzy\",\"abc\"]\n        Output: \"abc\"\n        Explanation: \n        - The difference integer array of \"adc\" is [3 - 0, 2 - 3] = [3, -1].\n        - The difference integer array of \"wzy\" is [25 - 22, 24 - 25]= [3, -1].\n        - The difference integer array of \"abc\" is [1 - 0, 2 - 1] = [1, 1]. \n        The odd array out is [1, 1], so we return the corresponding string, \"abc\".\n        Example 2:\n        Input: words = [\"aaa\",\"bob\",\"ccc\",\"ddd\"]\n        Output: \"bob\"\n        Explanation: All the integer arrays are [0, 0] except for \"bob\", which corresponds to [13, -13].\n        \"\"\"\n",

You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.\n        At every node i, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:\n            the price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,\n            the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.\n        The game goes on as follows:\n            Initially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.\n            At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.\n            For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:\n                If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.\n                If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is c, both of them receive c / 2 each.\n            If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node 0, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.\n        Return the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node.\n        Example 1:\n        Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6]\n        Output: 6\n        Explanation: \n        The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:\n        - Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.\n          Alice's net income is now -2.\n        - Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. \n          Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.\n          Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.\n        - Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.\n          Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.\n        - Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.\n        Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.\n        It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.\n        Example 2:\n        Input: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]\n        Output: -7280\n        Explanation: \n        Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.\n        Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280. \n        \"\"\"\n",
