Her team has already solved $k$ out of the $n$ problems in the problem set, but as the problems become harder, she begins to lose focus and her mind starts to wander. \nShe recalls hearing the judges talk about the difficulty of the problems, which they rate on an integer scale from $0$ to $100$, inclusive. In fact, one of the judges said that \u201cthe problem set has never been so tough, the average difficulty of the problems in the problem set is $d$!\u201d\nShe starts thinking about the problems her team has solved so far, and comes up with an estimate $s$ for their average difficulty.

For every $i > 1$, let $g_ i$ be the leftmost integer in $A$ that is strictly larger than $g_{i-1}$. If there for a given $i$ is no such integer, we say that the GIS of the sequence is the sequence $(g_1, g_2,..., g_{i - 1})$.\nYour task is to, given a permutation $A$, compute the GIS of $A$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $1 \\le N \\le 10^6$, the number of elements of the permutation $A$.

The leftmost integer larger than $2$ is $3$, so $g_2 = 3$. The leftmost integer larger than $3$ is $5$ ($1$ is too small), so $g_3 = 5$. The leftmost integer larger than $5$ is $7$, so $g_4 = 7$.

An updated flag with $51$ stars rather than the current one with $50$ would cause a huge jump in U.S. flag sales.

We represent this star arrangement compactly by the number of stars in the first two rows: 6,5.\nA $51$-star flag that has the same property can have three rows of $9$ stars, interlaced with three rows of $8$ stars (with a compact representation of 9,8). Conversely, if a state were to leave the union, one appealing representation would be seven rows of seven stars (7,7).\nA flag pattern is visually appealing if it satisfies the following conditions:\n - Every other row has the same number of stars.\n - Adjacent rows differ by no more than one star.\n - The first row cannot have fewer stars than the second row.\nYour team sees beyond the short-term change to $51$ for the US flag.

Because there is only a single mech unit available after previous monster rampages, the EDF has decided to simulate the upcoming battle between the mech and the monster before launching an assault. The EDF noted that the monster\u2019s attack pattern can be simulated by a series of moves that it performs in succession. When denoting each of its moves with a single letter, the attack pattern can be simulated as a single string, which should be read from left to right. The monster has the following moves:\n - Rake, denoted by the letter \u2018R\u2019;\n - Bite, denoted by the letter \u2018B\u2019;\n - Laser breath, denoted by the letter \u2018L\u2019.\nIn order to defeat the monster, the mech must perform a counter move per move that the monster makes:\n - Slice, denoted by the letter \u2018S\u2019, counters the monster\u2019s rake;\n - Kick, denoted by the letter \u2018K\u2019, counters the monster\u2019s bite;\n - Shield, denoted by the letter \u2018H\u2019, counters the monster\u2019s laser breath;\nHowever, there is one catch. When the monster performs a subsequent combination of the three moves Rake, Bite and Laser breath, in any order, it becomes a very powerful attack for which the mech must perform a single counter move called Combo breaker, denoted by the letter \u2018C\u2019. A single Combo breaker absorbs the entire combination of three moves. Any following moves from the monster will have to be countered separately or as part of a new combination. A move of the monster can never be part of more than one combination.\nThrough extensive analysis of the monster\u2019s past behaviour, the EDF is now able to reliably predict the actions of the monster ahead of time.

As an example of its amazing performance, your friend has told you that every file in your precious collection of random bit strings after compression would be at most $b$ bits long! Naturally, you find this a bit hard to believe, so you want to determine whether it is even theoretically possible for this to be true.\nYour collection of random bit strings consists of $N$ files, no two of which are identical, and each of which is exactly $1000$ bits long.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two integers $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 10^{15}$) and $b$ ($0 \\le b \\le 50$), giving the number of files in your collection and the maximum number of bits a compressed file is allowed to have.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a line containing either \u201cyes\u201d if it is possible to compress all the $N$ files in your collection into files of size at most $b$ bits, or \u201cno\u201d otherwise.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n13 3\nSample Output 1:\nyes\nSample Input 2:\n1 0\nSample Output 2:\nyes\n\ndef",

After trying to scare away the flies unsuccessfully for a few hours, he decided to ask for your help.\nMarin has sent you a picture of his window, the dimensions being $R \\times S$ pixels and has also told you the length of the side of the racket he uses to kill the flies, in pixels.

The picture\u2019s pixels marked with \u2018*\u2019 denote the position of a fly, whereas all the other pixels are marked with \u2018.\u2019 and denote empty space. On his window, there is at least one fly that Marin can kill with his racket.\n-----Output-----\nThe first line of output must contain the maximal number of flies Marin can kill in a single shot.\nThe folllowing $R$ lines must contain Marin\u2019s picture, on it clearly marked a position of the racket that will ensure Marin kills as many flies as possible. The horizontal sides of the racket are denoted with a series of characters \u2018-\u2019 and the vertical ones with \u2018|\u2019, whereas angles are denoted with \u2018+\u2019. For a more detailed explanation, consult the sample tests.\nPlease note: Marin\u2019s racket will affect only the flies located strictly inside the racket, and the racket must be located inside the window with all its parts.
