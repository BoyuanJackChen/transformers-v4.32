      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nBasin City is known for her incredibly high crime rates. The police see no option but to tighten security. They want to install traffic drones at different intersections to observe who\u2019s running on a red light. If a car runs a red light, the drone will chase and stop the car to give the driver an appropriate ticket. The drones are quite stupid, however, and a drone will stop before it comes to the next intersection as it might otherwise lose its way home, its home being the traffic light to which it is assigned. The drones are not able to detect the presence of other drones, so the police\u2019s R&D department found out that if a drone was placed at some intersection, then it was best not to put any drones at any of the neighbouring intersections. As is usual in many cities, there are no intersections in Basin City with more than four other neighbouring intersections.\nThe drones are government funded, so the police force would like to buy as many drones as they are allowed to. Being the programmer-go-to for the Basin City Police Department, they ask you to decide, for a given number of drones, whether it is feasible to position exactly this number of drones.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $k$ ($0 \\leq k \\leq 15$), giving the number of drones to position. Then follows one line with $1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\; 000$, the total number of intersections in Basin City. Finally follow\u00a0$n$ lines describing consecutive intersections. The $i$-th line describes the $i$-th intersection in the following format: The line starts with one integer $d$ ($0 \\leq d \\leq 4$) describing the number of intersections neighbouring the $i$-th one. Then follow $d$ integers denoting the indices of these neighbouring intersections. They will be all distinct and different from $i$. The intersections are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible to position $k$ drones such that no two neighbouring intersections have been assigned a drone, output a single line containing possible. Otherwise, output a single line containing impossible.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n7\n2 2 4\n3 1 3 5\n1 2\n2 1 5\n4 2 6 4 7\n2 5 7\n2 6 5\nSample Output:\nimpossible\n\ndef",

So they decide to hire a messenger. Since the cost of the messenger service depends on the time it takes to deliver the package, they need your help to optimize a little bit.\nAssume Misha and Nadia move on a two-dimensional plane, each visiting a sequence of places and moving along straight line segments from place to place. Your task is to find the shortest possible delivery time given their two paths.\nMisha hands the package to the messenger at some point along his path. The messenger moves without delay along a straight line from the pick-up to intercept Nadia, who is traveling along her path. Misha, Nadia and the messenger move with a constant speed of $1$ distance unit per time unit. The delivery time is the time between Misha handing over the package and Nadia receiving it.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The test case contains two path descriptions, the first for Misha and the second for Nadia. Each path description starts with a line containing an integer $n$, the number of places visited ($2 \\leq n \\leq 50000$). This is followed by $n$ lines, each with two integers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ specifying the coordinates of a place ($0 \\leq x_ i, y_ i \\leq 30000$). Coordinates of the places are listed in the order in which they are to be visited, and successive places do not have the same coordinates.\nMisha and Nadia start their journeys at the same time, visiting the places along their paths without stopping. The length of each path is at most $10^6$. The package must be picked up at the latest when Misha reaches his final place and it must be delivered at the latest when Nadia reaches her final place.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the minimal time needed for delivery.

In this project, a wireless sensor network in the Amazon rainforest gathers environmental information. The Amazon rainforest stores an amount of carbon equivalent to a decade of global fossil fuel emissions, and it plays a crucial role in the world\u2019s oxygen-transfer processes. Because of the huge size of this forest, changes in the forest affect not only the local environment but also global climate by altering wind and ocean current patterns.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nThe BASIC computer programming language has been popular for many years, and there have been dozens of \u2018dialects\u2019 of the language. It\u2019s considered a high-level language and is typically interpreted (rather than compiled). For this problem, write an interpreter for a restricted dialect of BASIC. Here is a description of the language.\nEach input line contains one statement. Each statement begins with a non-negative integer, which we will call its label. Following the label is a single space and one of the following commands (with explanations following):\n - LET X = <ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT>\n Assign the result of the arithmetic statement to variable X.\n - IF <CONDITION> THEN GOTO L\n If the boolean given is true, then go to the statement labeled L, where L is a valid label. (If the condition is not true, continue execution to the statement with the next lowest label.)\n - PRINT <PRINT_STATEMENT>\n Produce output, without an appended newline.\n - PRINTLN <PRINT_STATEMENT>\n Produce output, with an appended newline.\nHere are details on types, variables, and the terms <ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT>, <CONDITION>, and <PRINT_STATEMENT> used above.\n - All numeric values (in the input and for the variable representation) are signed 32-bit integers.\n - All variables are single uppercase characters (A through Z). They are all global in scope, and are all initialized to zero before program execution begins.\n - <ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT> is one of the following: X, X + Y, X - Y, X * Y, or X / Y. Here, X and Y each indicate either a variable or an integer.\n - <CONDITION> is one of the following: X = Y, X > Y, X < Y, X <> Y, X <= Y, or X >= Y. Again, X and Y each indicate either a variable or an integer. Here, <> indicates inequality.\n - <PRINT_STATEMENT> is either a variable name or a literal string delimited by double quotes. Inside the quotes, the string contains only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and spaces.\nIn the signed 32-bit arithmetic, the usual rules of truncation towards zero (for division) and overflow (for addition and multiplication) and underflow (for subtraction) apply. The following examples illustrate these conditions:\n5 / 2   = 2  65536 * 32768   = -2147483648\n-1 / 2  = 0  -65536 * 32768  = -2147483648\n2147483647 + 1  = -2147483648        -2147483648 * 2 = 0\n-2147483648 - 1 = 2147483647 2147483647 * 2  = -2\nFurther, division by zero will not occur.\nProgram execution begins with the statement having the smallest label, and proceeds with the statement having the next smallest label. (Unless a GOTO executes, in which case execution proceeds at the designated label.) The program halts after it has completed the statement with the largest label (which is guaranteed not to contain a GOTO).\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a single program. Each line contains a single valid statement. Each pair of adjacent tokens in the input is separated by a single space. Integers in the input will all be in the range $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$. Input ends at end of file.\n-----Output-----\nGive the output (PRINT and PRINTLN statements) of the input program when it is executed.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 LET A = 1\n20 PRINT \"HELLO THERE \"\n30 PRINTLN A\n40 LET A = A + 1\n50 IF A <= 5 THEN GOTO 20\n60 PRINTLN \"DONE\"\nSample Output:\nHELLO THERE 1\nHELLO THERE 2\nHELLO THERE 3\nHELLO THERE 4\nHELLO THERE 5\nDONE\n\ndef",

One of the trees grew from the left, and the other from the right.

We can describe this subtree with a list of $n-1$ edges.\nSimilarly, the right tree also connected all nodes in a single subtree rooted in node $n$, with every node\u2019s children having smaller numbers than the node itself.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nOne morning last summer, Charlotte was watching the moon and the sun and observed that the moon was full. As she lives along the Atlantic coast she knows that this means a larger variation in the tide compared to first and last quarter. With no rain in the air, it seemed like a perfect week for walks at the beach by the cliffs.\nThe tide is dangerous when walking at the beach between the sea and the cliff wall. As the water rises, you may get trapped. Therefore it is important to plan the walk according to the behaviour of the tide.\nOne simple way of cliff walk planning is just to start walking and turn around at low tide. The problem is that on a rocky beach, you want the rocks to dry for one hour before entering them. It could therefore actually be safe to continue the walk a bit further even after low tide. Note that the beach is mostly made of sand and the rocks have many cracks in them, so we assume that all areas are flooded or drained at the exact moment when the tide reaches their height, irrespective of the heights of the neighbouring areas.\nThe beach has been surveyed and a map is available where each $10\\times 10$m square has a certain height. Each square can only be entered from the four neighbouring squares to the north, south, east and west. It is only possible to pass between two squares of height $z_1, z_2$ if the absolute height difference $|z_1 - z_2|$ is at most $1$ meter. Charlotte walks in such a way that it takes a constant amount of time to pass from one square to another and during the whole time period both squares must be dry.\nThe tide behaves differently at different places on the Earth depending on the sea bottom, coast line etc. Charlotte knows that it is possible to approximate the tide\u2019s water level $v$ as $v = 0.5a\\cdot (\\cos (t\\frac{2\\pi }{12})+1)$, where $t$ is time in hours since the last high tide and $a$ is a number depending on the location, time of the year, etc.\nCharlotte will start and finish her walk at her home. She limits her time away from home to only one tide interval, so you may assume that $0.0 \\leq t \\leq 12.0$. How far from home is she able to get and still return safely back?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two floating point numbers $a$, $0.0 < a < 15.0$, and $m$, $0.1 \\leq m \\leq 60.0$, the number of seconds it takes to pass one square on the map. The second line contains four integers $W$, $H$, $X$ and $Y$ where $1 \\le W,H \\le 200$, $0 \\le X < W$ and $0 \\le Y < H$. $W$ and $H$ are the width and height of the map of the coast, $X$ and $Y$ describes the coordinate $(X, Y)$ of Charlotte\u2019s home.\nThen follow $H$ lines each containing $W$ space separated integers, describing the height in millimetres of each $10\\times 10$m surveyed square compared to extreme low tide. You can assume that the height of each square will be at least $0$ and at most $20000$ milimetres. The first number on the first line corresponds to coordinate $(0, 0)$. Charlotte\u2019s home will always be dry.\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line with the maximum Euclidean distance that Charlotte can get from home. The distance between two squares should be measured between their centers. The answer is considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.\nTo avoid problems with floating point numbers, the result is guaranteed to be the same for all walking speeds $m\u2019$ where $0.999 m < m\u2019 < 1.001 m$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2.0 10.0\n3 3 0 0\n2001 1000 100\n1001 10000 200\n100 0 0\nSample Output:\n20\n\ndef",

Some kids, of course, are old enough to leave, but those who stay for another year are rearranged among the three teachers.\nThe teachers even let the kids have their say in the process. As friendship both comes and goes hastily in young years, each kid $X$ ranks every other kid $Y$ according to how glad $X$ would be to have $Y$ in her new class. In fact, $X$ produces a preference list giving a total order of the other kids, i.e. there are no such things as ties \u2013 kids she would be equally glad to have as classmates.\nThe three teachers do not mind if the new classes formed are unbalanced in size, since they fill up their classes with new kids about to start their first year at the kindergarten. They do, however, want all the kids in their own new class to be different from last year, since even a teacher needs a break after a whole year with the same kids. They decide that a best partition into three classes under these premises is one where no kid is in the same class as a kid not listed among the top $T$ entries on their preference list, for $T$ as small as possible.

Archeologists have made findings which indicate that already in the Middle Ages, infantry were practicing for programming contests while not in battle. Although it is not known how the programming contests were carried out (there were no computers), the archeologists have come up with a good theory (according to them). It states that infantry submitted pseudocode carved into stone, and then by the end of the contest, a genius priest named K\u00e1tisse ran all the programs in her head for correction. How they know her name? They won\u2019t say. \nOne of the reasons for this somewhat peculiar theory was the finding of ancient pike, a combat spear. Scientists have found many of these throughout the years. They come with a special symbol carved into them, usually the symbol of the tribe. This one didn\u2019t have a symbol carved into it, it had pseudo code for Fenwick trees, as well as a config file for some kind of editor. Scientists are unsure which editor it might have been, but they believe it was some version of the closed Emacs beta.\nInstead of looking for more evidence, the archeologists started speculating what strategy the pikemen used in these programming contests. They must have been well prepared, since this guy had algorithms carved into his spear. The contest rules were probably as follows: When submiting a solution to the judge, the time in minutes from contest start was added to a penalty counter. So in order to plan his problem solving, a pikeman must have been good at approximating the number of minutes required to solve each problem.\nYou are given a number of problems which were designed for a contest in which the pikeman participated. For each problem, you are given the estimated time in minutes for solving the problem. Calculate the maximum number of problems a pikeman can solve in the contest, and the minimum penalty he can get, under the assumptions that these estimations are correct. You may assume that the pikemen are very efficient: submissions are always correct, and after submitting a problem they start solving the next problem immediately.\n-----Input-----\nInput starts with two integers on a single line $1 \\le N \\le 10^9$ and $ 1 \\le T \\le 10^{18}$, the number of problems in the ancient contest and the total length of the contest in minutes.

The graph has the special property that any connected component of size $s$ contains no more than $s + 2$ edges. You are also given two integers $k$ and $P$. Find the number of $k$-colourings of the graph, modulo $P$.\nRecall that a simple graph is an undirected graph with no self loops and no repeated edges. A $k$-colouring of a graph is a way to assign to each node of the graph exactly one of $k$ colours, such that if edge $(u, v)$ is present in the graph, then $u$ and $v$ receive different colors.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of four integers, $N, M, k$, and $P$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 50000$, $0 \\leq M \\leq 1.5 N$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$, $1 \\leq P \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^9$). The next $M$ lines of input each contains a pair of integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \\leq A \\leq N$, $1 \\leq B \\leq N$), describing an edge in the graph connecting nodes $A$ and $B$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of $k$-colourings of the given graph, modulo $P$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 3 2 10000\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\nSample Output:\n0\n\ndef",

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nYou found a complete, undirected graph with $n$ nodes, labeled $1$ to $n$. Each edge has a color. For simplicity, each color is identified by a number between $1$ and $300$ inclusive. Interestingly, you noticed that for each and every simple cycle in this graph, there are at least two adjacent edges on this cycle which have the same color.\nFor each non-empty subset of nodes in graph $S$, let $f(S)$ denote the size of the maximum subset of nodes you can choose from $S$ such that all edges between the chosen nodes are the same color. Compute the sum of $f(S)$ over all non empty subsets $S$ of nodes in the graph.\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will contain a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 300$), which is the number of nodes in the graph.\nThe next $n$ lines will each contain $n$ integers $c$ ($0 \\le c \\le 300$), which is a matrix representing the colors of the edges, where $c[x,y]$ is the color of the edge between node $x$ and node $y$. It is guaranteed that the values on the diagonal will be $0$ ($c[x,x]=0$), since there is no edge from a node to itself. It is also guaranteed that the matrix is symmetric and the off-diagonal colors range from $1$ to $300$ ($1 \\le c[x,y] = c[y,x] \\le 300$ for $x \\ne y$).\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, which is the sum of $f(S)$ over all non empty subsets $S$ of nodes in the graph.
