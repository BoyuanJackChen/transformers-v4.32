For an integer $k$, a pair of indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\le i<j \\le n$) is called a $k$-inversion if and only if $s[i] = \\textbf{B}$, $s[j] = \\textbf{A}$ and $j-i = k$.\nConsider the string BABA. It has two $1$-inversions and one $3$-inversion. It has no $2$-inversions.\nFor each $k$ between $1$ and $n-1$ (inclusive), print the number of $k$-inversions in the string $s$.\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The input will consist of a single line with a string $s$, which consists of only upper case As and Bs. The string $s$ will be between $1$ and $1000000$ characters long. There will be no spaces.\n-----Output-----\nOutput $n-1$ lines, each with a single integer. The first line\u2019s integer should be the number of $1$-inversions, the second should be the number of $2$-inversions, and so on.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nBABA\nSample Output:\n2\n0\n1\n\ndef",
