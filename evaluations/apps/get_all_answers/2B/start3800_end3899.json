The website does not display each picture with equal probability. The $i$-th picture has a non-negative weight $w_i$, and the probability of the $i$-th picture being displayed is $\\frac{w_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^nw_j}$. That is to say, the probability of a picture to be displayed is proportional to its weight.\nHowever, Nauuo discovered that some pictures she does not like were displayed too often. \nTo solve this problem, she came up with a great idea: when she saw a picture she likes, she would add $1$ to its weight; otherwise, she would subtract $1$ from its weight.\nNauuo will visit the website $m$ times. She wants to know the expected weight of each picture after all the $m$ visits modulo $998244353$. Can you help her?\nThe expected weight of the $i$-th picture can be denoted by $\\frac {q_i} {p_i}$ where $\\gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$, you need to print an integer $r_i$ satisfying $0\\le r_i<998244353$ and $r_i\\cdot p_i\\equiv q_i\\pmod{998244353}$. It can be proved that such $r_i$ exists and is unique.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1\\le n\\le 50$, $1\\le m\\le 50$) \u2014 the number of pictures and the number of visits to the website.\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ ($a_i$ is either $0$ or $1$) \u2014 if $a_i=0$, Nauuo does not like the $i$-th picture; otherwise Nauuo likes the $i$-th picture.

The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view): [Image] \nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other.

A person's weight is either 50 kilos or 100 kilos.\nYou can consider Greg and his friends indexed in some way.\n-----Output-----\nIn the first line print an integer \u2014 the minimum number of rides. If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print an integer -1.\nIn the second line print the remainder after dividing the number of ways to transport the people in the minimum number of rides by number 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print integer 0.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 50\n50\nOutput\n1\n1\nInput\n3 100\n50 50 100\nOutput\n5\n2\nInput\n2 50\n50 50\nOutput\n-1\n0\n-----Note-----\nIn the first test Greg walks alone and consequently, he needs only one ride across the river.\nIn the second test you should follow the plan:\n  transport two 50 kg. people;  transport one 50 kg. person back;  transport one 100 kg. person;  transport one 50 kg. person back;  transport two 50 kg. people. \nThat totals to 5 rides. Depending on which person to choose at step 2, we can get two distinct ways.\n\ndef",

Before unpacking, Nora decided to make a fun game for ROBO.\nShe labelled all $n$ boxes with $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ and asked ROBO to do the following action several (possibly zero) times:\n  Pick three distinct indices $i$, $j$ and $k$, such that $a_i \\mid a_j$ and $a_i \\mid a_k$. In other words, $a_i$ divides both $a_j$ and $a_k$, that is $a_j \\bmod a_i = 0$, $a_k \\bmod a_i = 0$.  After choosing, Nora will give the $k$-th box to ROBO, and he will place it on top of the box pile at his side. Initially, the pile is empty.  After doing so, the box $k$ becomes unavailable for any further actions. \nBeing amused after nine different tries of the game, Nora asked ROBO to calculate the number of possible different piles having the largest amount of boxes in them. Two piles are considered different if there exists a position where those two piles have different boxes.\nSince ROBO was still in his infant stages, and Nora was still too young to concentrate for a long time, both fell asleep before finding the final answer. Can you help them?\nAs the number of such piles can be very large, you should print the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 60$), denoting the number of boxes.\nThe second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 60$), where $a_i$ is the label of the $i$-th box.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of distinct piles having the maximum number of boxes that ROBO_Head can have, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 6 8\nOutput\n2\nInput\n5\n2 3 4 9 12\nOutput\n4\nInput\n4\n5 7 2 9\nOutput\n1\n-----Note-----\nLet's illustrate the box pile as a sequence $b$, with the pile's bottommost box being at the leftmost position.\nIn the first example, there are $2$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [6]$ ($[2, \\mathbf{6}, 8] \\xrightarrow{(1, 3, 2)} [2, 8]$)  $b = [8]$ ($[2, 6, \\mathbf{8}] \\xrightarrow{(1, 2, 3)} [2, 6]$) \nIn the second example, there are $4$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [9, 12]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{12}] \\xrightarrow{(1, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 4]$)  $b = [4, 12]$ ($[2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, 9, \\mathbf{12}] \\xrightarrow{(2, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 9]$)  $b = [4, 9]$ ($[2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$)  $b = [9, 4]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$) \nIn the third sequence, ROBO can do nothing at all.

They take so much space and there could be a road on the place they occupy!\nThe Mayor thinks that one of the main city streets could be considerably widened on account of lawn nobody needs anyway. Moreover, that might help reduce the car jams which happen from time to time on the street.\nThe street is split into n equal length parts from left to right, the i-th part is characterized by two integers: width of road s_{i} and width of lawn g_{i}. [Image] \nFor each of n parts the Mayor should decide the size of lawn to demolish. For the i-th part he can reduce lawn width by integer x_{i} (0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 g_{i}). After it new road width of the i-th part will be equal to s'_{i} = s_{i} + x_{i} and new lawn width will be equal to g'_{i} = g_{i} - x_{i}.\nOn the one hand, the Mayor wants to demolish as much lawn as possible (and replace it with road). On the other hand, he does not want to create a rapid widening or narrowing of the road, which would lead to car accidents.

Throughout the whole year, Innopolis citizens suffer from everlasting city construction. \nFrom the window in your room, you see the sequence of n hills, where i-th of them has height a_{i}. The Innopolis administration wants to build some houses on the hills. However, for the sake of city appearance, a house can be only built on the hill, which is strictly higher than neighbouring hills (if they are present). For example, if the sequence of heights is 5, 4, 6, 2, then houses could be built on hills with heights 5 and 6 only.\nThe Innopolis administration has an excavator, that can decrease the height of an arbitrary hill by one in one hour. The excavator can only work on one hill at a time. It is allowed to decrease hills up to zero height, or even to negative values. Increasing height of any hill is impossible. The city administration wants to build k houses, so there must be at least k hills that satisfy the condition above. What is the minimum time required to adjust the hills to achieve the administration's plan?\nHowever, the exact value of k is not yet determined, so could you please calculate answers for all k in range $1 \\leq k \\leq \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$?

Hence, all the team of friendly curators and teachers started composing the camp's schedule. After some continuous discussion, they came up with a schedule $s$, which can be represented as a binary string, in which the $i$-th symbol is '1' if students will write the contest in the $i$-th day and '0' if they will have a day off.\nAt the last moment Gleb said that the camp will be the most productive if it runs with the schedule $t$ (which can be described in the same format as schedule $s$). Since the number of days in the current may be different from number of days in schedule $t$, Gleb required that the camp's schedule must be altered so that the number of occurrences of $t$ in it as a substring is maximum possible. At the same time, the number of contest days and days off shouldn't change, only their order may change.\nCould you rearrange the schedule in the best possible way?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains string $s$ ($1 \\leqslant |s| \\leqslant 500\\,000$), denoting the current project of the camp's schedule.\nThe second line contains string $t$ ($1 \\leqslant |t| \\leqslant 500\\,000$), denoting the optimal schedule according to Gleb.\nStrings $s$ and $t$ contain characters '0' and '1' only.\n-----Output-----\nIn the only line print the schedule having the largest number of substrings equal to $t$.

To celebrate this event her mother bought her a multiplication table $M$ with $n$ rows and $n$ columns such that $M_{ij}=a_i \\cdot a_j$ where $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ is some sequence of positive integers.\nOf course, the girl decided to take it to school with her. But while she was having lunch, hooligan Grisha erased numbers on the main diagonal and threw away the array $a_1, \\dots, a_n$. Help Sasha restore the array!\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 10^3$), the size of the table. \nThe next $n$ lines contain $n$ integers each. The $j$-th number of the $i$-th line contains the number $M_{ij}$ ($1 \\leq M_{ij} \\leq 10^9$). The table has zeroes on the main diagonal, that is, $M_{ii}=0$.\n-----Output-----\nIn a single line print $n$ integers, the original array $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$). It is guaranteed that an answer exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n0 4 6 2 4\n4 0 6 2 4\n6 6 0 3 6\n2 2 3 0 2\n4 4 6 2 0\nOutput\n2 2 3 1 2 \nInput\n3\n0 99990000 99970002\n99990000 0 99980000\n99970002 99980000 0\nOutput\n9999 10000 9998\n\ndef",

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nElections in Berland are coming. There are only two candidates \u2014 Alice and Bob.\nThe main Berland TV channel plans to show political debates. There are $n$ people who want to take part in the debate as a spectator. Each person is described by their influence and political views. There are four kinds of political views:  supporting none of candidates (this kind is denoted as \"00\"),  supporting Alice but not Bob (this kind is denoted as \"10\"),  supporting Bob but not Alice (this kind is denoted as \"01\"),  supporting both candidates (this kind is denoted as \"11\"). \nThe direction of the TV channel wants to invite some of these people to the debate. The set of invited spectators should satisfy three conditions:  at least half of spectators support Alice (i.e. $2 \\cdot a \\ge m$, where $a$ is number of spectators supporting Alice and $m$ is the total number of spectators),  at least half of spectators support Bob (i.e. $2 \\cdot b \\ge m$, where $b$ is number of spectators supporting Bob and $m$ is the total number of spectators),  the total influence of spectators is maximal possible. \nHelp the TV channel direction to select such non-empty set of spectators, or tell that this is impossible.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 4\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of people who want to take part in the debate as a spectator.\nThese people are described on the next $n$ lines. Each line describes a single person and contains the string $s_i$ and integer $a_i$ separated by space ($1 \\le a_i \\le 5000$), where $s_i$ denotes person's political views (possible values \u2014 \"00\", \"10\", \"01\", \"11\") and $a_i$ \u2014 the influence of the $i$-th person.\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single integer \u2014 maximal possible total influence of a set of spectators so that at least half of them support Alice and at least half of them support Bob. If it is impossible print 0 instead.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n11 6\n10 4\n01 3\n00 3\n00 7\n00 9\nOutput\n22\nInput\n5\n11 1\n01 1\n00 100\n10 1\n01 1\nOutput\n103\nInput\n6\n11 19\n10 22\n00 18\n00 29\n11 29\n10 28\nOutput\n105\nInput\n3\n00 5000\n00 5000\n00 5000\nOutput\n0\n-----Note-----\nIn the first example $4$ spectators can be invited to maximize total influence: $1$, $2$, $3$ and $6$. Their political views are: \"11\", \"10\", \"01\" and \"00\". So in total $2$ out of $4$ spectators support Alice and $2$ out of $4$ spectators support Bob. The total influence is $6+4+3+9=22$.\nIn the second example the direction can select all the people except the $5$-th person.\nIn the third example the direction can select people with indices: $1$, $4$, $5$ and $6$.\nIn the fourth example it is impossible to select any non-empty set of spectators.\n\ndef",
