You can also pass through a light at the exact moment of changing colour. There are no traffic lights at the start or the end of the road.\nNow your car is special; it is an iCar, the first Orange car, and it has only one button. When you hold down the button, the car accelerates at a constant rate of $1 \\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}^2$; when you release the button the car stops on the spot.\nYou have driven to work many times, so you happen to know the schedules of the traffic lights. Now the question is, how quickly can you get to work?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$, the length of the road in kilometers ($1 \\leq n \\leq 16$). Each of the next $n-1$ lines contains $3$ integers $t_ i$, $g_ i$ and $r_ i$, the first time the $i$-th light will switch from red to green after the moment you start driving the car; the green light duration, and the red light duration ($40\\leq g_ i,r_ i\\leq 50$; $0 \\leq t_ i < g_ i+r_ i$). Times are given in seconds.\nYou may assume that any light with $t_ i > r_ i$ is green at the time you start driving the car, and switches to red $t_ i - r_ i$ seconds later.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the minimum time required to reach the end of the road.

Additionally, after a chameleon colored in colour $a$ moving to the left collides with a chameleon colored in colour $b$ moving to the right, the chameleon moving to the left before the collision takes the color of the chameleon moving to the right before the collision (so, color $b$), while the chameleon moving to the right before the collision takes a new color $(a + b) \\bmod K$.\nIf you are given the initial positions, colors and directions of movement of all the chameleons, for each color determine the total trip taken by the chameleons in that color before getting off the stick.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integers $N$, $K$ and $L$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$, $1 \\leq K \\leq 40$, $1 \\leq L \\leq 1000000$) from the task. The $i$-th of the following $N$ lines contains the integer $d_ i$ ($0 \\leq d_ i \\leq L$) that denotes the distance between the $i$-th chameleon and the left end of the stick, then the integer $b_ i$ ($0 \\leq b_ i \\leq K - 1$) that denotes the color of the $i$-th chameleon and the character \u2018L\u2019 (left) or \u2018D\u2019 (right) that denote the direction of movement of the $i$-th chameleon. All integers $d_ i$ will be unique and given in strictly ascending order.\n-----Output-----\nThe output must contain $K$ lines, the $i$-th line containing the total trip taken by the chameleons in color $i$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 3 10\n0 0 D\n10 1 L\nSample Output 1:\n10.0\n10.0\n0.0\nSample Input 2:\n4 3 7\n1 0 D\n3 0 D\n4 1 L\n6 2 D\nSample Output 2:\n10.0\n4.0\n1.0\n\ndef",

This turned into a big disaster: on the way there, a fire in a control room caused huge delays, while on the return trip, trains in Bremen were delayed due to a terrorist threat in Hamburg. Of course, these huge delays caused other delays in the train schedule, so the big question was which trains to take: would it be better to take this slow regional train now, or wait for that intercity train, which has a big chance of being delayed?\nThis year, the judges have planned ahead and carefully analyzed the train schedule. They even kept track of how often trains were delayed and by how much. Now that they have all this information, they want to travel as quickly possible, minimizing the expected duration of the journey. Can you help them?\nFor each train connection, the judges know exactly what its scheduled departure time and duration are, as well as the probability that its arrival at the destination will be delayed. You may assume that the probabilities of delays are independent and that the judges can adapt their itinerary as they go, depending on any delays which they might already have incurred. Trains always depart on time, but may arrive late and the judges do not know whether a train\u2019s arrival will be delayed until they have boarded it. It takes judges no time to switch trains, so they can take a connecting train that departs at the same time as they arrive at a place.\nThe judges can choose the time of their initial departure as they wish and they want to minimize the expected duration1 of their total trip.\n-----Input-----\n - one line with the judges\u2019 place of origin and destination, these are different.\n - one line with an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$): the number of train connections.\n - $n$ lines, each describing a train connection:\n - the origin and destination of this connection, these are different.\n - an integer $m$ ($0\\leq m\\leq 59$), the departure time in minutes after each full hour.\n - an integer $t$ ($1\\leq t\\leq 300$), the standard journey time (assuming no delays).\n - an integer $p$ ($0\\leq p\\leq 100$), the probability of delays as a percentage.\n - an integer $d$ ($1\\leq d\\leq 120$), the maximum delay in minutes.\nAll place names are given as strings of upper and lower case alphabetical characters, of length at most 20. If a train is delayed, then the length of the delay will be a whole number of minutes, and will be uniformly distributed in the range $[1,d]$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a floating point number: the minimum expected duration of the total trip in minutes.

Write a program to read in paragraphs of text and to produce a list of similarly spelled words occurring in that text.\nFor the purpose of this program, a word is any maximal string of non-whitespace characters containing at least one alphabetic character. Whitespace can be either blanks or line terminators (\u201c\\r\u201d or \u201c\\n\u201d). The core of a word is what you have left after removing any non-alphabetic characters and replacing any upper-case alphabetic characters to their lower-case equivalents.\nTwo words are considered to be similarly spelled if the core of one word can be converted to the core of the other word by a single application of any one of the following transformations:\n - Delete a single character.\n - Insert a single alphabetic character.\n - Replace a single character by a different alphabetic character.\n - Transpose (exchange) any two adjacent characters.\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of $1$ to $100$ lines of text, followed by an end of input marker in the form of a line containing only the string \u201c***\u201d.\nEach line of text will contain $0$ to $80$ ASCII characters (not counting line terminators).\n-----Output-----\nFor each word core in the text that has one or more similarly spelled words, print a line consisting of\n - That word core\n - A colon (\u201c:\u201d) followed by a blank\n - A list of all similarly spelled word cores (with no duplicates and not containing the core to the left of the colons), in alphabetic order, separated by single spaces.\nThe lines printed should be in alphabetic order of the word cores to the left of the colon.\nIf there are no similarly spelled words in the input, print a single line containing the string \u201c***\u201d.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nLost is Close to Lose\n\"Better Documents Inc. wants to add Typo Checking in to the\nnext generation of word processors,\" he said.\n***\nSample Output 1:\nclose: lose\nhe: the\nin: inc is\ninc: in\nis: in\nlose: close lost\nlost: lose\nthe: he\nSample Input 2:\nThe fox said, \"When?\"\n\"Not till 12 o'clock\", replied the hen.\n\"That clock is stopped, it will never strike.\", he said.\n***\nSample Output 2:\nclock: oclock\nhe: hen the\nhen: he when\nis: it\nit: is\noclock: clock\nthe: he\ntill: will\nwhen: hen\nwill: till\n\ndef",

Some day, he will be able to fly with it. This weekend, Emil is on a vacation in New York. He has compiled a list of cool places to visit, as well as a list of all one-way streets between these places, and now it is time for some sightseeing! \nOne sightseeing trip consists of $S$ places and exactly $S$ streets which connect them. He starts by travelling to one of these places by subway, with his moped on his back. Then he starts riding his moped to each place of the trip in turn, finally returning to where he started in the current trip. Then he goes back to the subway, with his moped on his back, and goes for the next trip. He does this until he has enjoyed all of the trips.\nSince it\u2019s very hard to determine if Emil can visit all of the places he wants to see in a single trip of this kind, he has instead asked you to help him split all of the $N$ places in town into a number of trips, such that each place in town is included in exactly one trip.\nGiven all the places Emil wants to see and the streets of the city connecting these, construct a list of trips fulfilling these conditions, or determine that it is impossible. Each trip must use at least one street, and there may be loops, i.e. streets with a start and end point in the same place.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of two integers $1\\le N \\le 100$ and $0 \\le M \\le 10000$, the number of places Emil wants to visit and the number of roads respectively. The places are numbered $0$ to $N-1$.\nThe next $M$ lines consists of two integers $0 \\le f, t \\le N-1$, denoting that there is a one-way street from place $f$ to place $t$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput begins with an integer $N$ on its own line, the number of trips made. Then, for every trip, output a line with the number of places included in the trip $K$, followed by $K$ lines, containing the numbers of said places in order of visit (the last place which Emil returns to should not be output twice).\nIf the places can\u2019t be split into trips, Emil instead goes bowling.

If at least one of the neighbour\u2019s resum\u00e9\u2019s perceived value is strictly greater than their resum\u00e9\u2019s perceived value, they leave the queue since they do not want to waste their time. The candidates all look at their neighbor\u2019s resum\u00e9 simultaneously, and then some candidates leave the queue simultaneously.\nThis process continues until no more candidates leave the queue. Determine the number of minutes that pass while this process takes place. Report the values of the candidates that leave the queue in each round. Also report the final state of the queue.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$), which is the number of candidates.\nThe second line contains $N$ integers $v_1, \\ldots, v_ N$ ($0 \\leq v_ i \\leq 10^9$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq N$), where $v_ i$ is the perceived value of the $i^\\textrm {th}$ candidate.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay $M$, the number of minutes taken by this process. Then display $M$ lines. The $i^\\textrm {th}$ line should contain the perceived values of the candidates who left the queue in the $i^\\textrm {th}$ minute in the same relative order that they appeared in the queue. Finally display a line indicating the final list of perceived values in the queue after candidates no longer leave it.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n10\n3 6 2 3 2 2 2 1 5 6\nSample Output 1:\n2\n3 2 2 1 5\n3 2 2\n6 6\nSample Input 2:\n3\n17 17 17\nSample Output 2:\n0\n17 17 17\n\ndef",

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nThe Newton brothers are planning to rob a bank in the city of Alviso and want to figure out a way to escape the city\u2019s only police car. They know that their car is faster than the police car so if they could just reach one of the highways exiting the city they will be able to speed away from the police.\nThe police car has a maximum speed of 160 km/h. Luckily, the brothers know where the police car will start (it\u2019s parked at the police station). To be on the safe side they assume that the police car will start moving as soon as they leave the bank and start their car (this is when the alarm goes off).\nThe brothers want to find a fixed route that ensures that they are able to leave the city no matter what route the police car take and at what speed it drives. However, since the brothers are not very confident drivers they don\u2019t want to drive faster than necessary. Luckily they have recently invested in a new hi-tech in-car police escape system that you have constructed. This system will tell them what the minimal top speed needed to escape is (and probably other useful things like what route to take).\nLet\u2019s turn the clock back a bit to the time when you were constructing the escape system and focused on finding the minimal required speed. Can you get it right?\nYou may treat all roads as infinitesimally narrow and both cars as point objects. If the brothers ever end up at the same point (on any road or intersection) at the same time as the police car they will be caught and by Murphy\u2019s law if there is any possibility of this happening it will happen. The two cars start simultaneously and can accelerate/decelerate instantaneously at any time to any speed below or equal to its maximum speed. They can also change roads at intersections or direction anywhere on a road instantaneously no matter what speed they are traveling at.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input consists of three integers $n$, $m$ and $e$, where $2 \\le n \\le 100$ describe the number of intersections, $1 \\le m \\le 5000$ describes the number of roads in the city and $1 \\le e \\le n$ describes the number of highway exits. Then follow $m$ lines, each consisting of three integers $a,b,l$ such that $1 \\le a < b \\le n$ and $1 \\le l \\le 100$ describing a road of length $l$ hundred meters from intersection $a$ to intersection $b$. Then follows a line of $e$ integers, each one a number in $1, \\ldots, n$ describing which intersections are connected to highway exits. Finally there is a line with two integers $b$ and $p$ ($1 \\le b,p \\le n \\text { and } b \\neq p$) describing the intersections where the brothers and the police cars start, respectively.\nIt will always be possible to travel from any intersection to any other intersection. Roads are only connected at intersection points (although they may cross using bridges or tunnels at others points). Roads can be used in both directions but there cannot be more than one road between two intersections.\n-----Output-----\nThe minimal speed in km/h required to escape or the word IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible. In the first case any answer with either absolute or relative error smaller than $10^{-6}$ is acceptable.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 2 1\n1 2 7\n2 3 8\n1\n3 2\nSample Output 1:\nIMPOSSIBLE\nSample Input 2:\n3 2 1\n1 2 7\n2 3 8\n1\n2 3\nSample Output 2:\n74.6666666667\n\ndef",

Two large food chains have recently reached an agreement on market sharing. In the middle of each road, exactly one chain will be given rights to build a restaurant.\nTo ensure the market is shared fairly, each city must have at least one restaurant from each chain on the roads connected to that city.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nYou are participating in a programming contest cup. The cup consists of a series of programming contests, followed by a final at the end of the season for the $15$ top ranked contestants in the cup. With only one contest left to go before the final, you are starting to wonder if your performance in the earlier contests has been good enough to already secure you a spot in the finals. If so, you could succumb to your laziness and skip the last contest.\nThe ranking of the cup works as follows. In each contest, a contestant earns some number of points between $0$ and $101$ (the details of this are described below). Their aggregate score is then defined to be the sum of the four highest scores achieved. For instance if a contestant got $45$, $15$, $32$, $0$, $30$, and $20$ points over $6$ contests, their aggregate score is $45+32+30+20=127$. The rank of a contestant X in the cup is defined to be $1$ plus the number of contestants that have a strictly larger aggregate score than X.\nThe score a contestant earns from a contest is based on the rank they achieve in that contest, according to the following table.\nRank\nPoints\nRank\nPoints\nRank\nPoints\n$1$\n$100$\n$11$\n$24$\n$21$\n$10$\n$2$\n$75$\n$12$\n$22$\n$22$\n$9$\n$3$\n$60$\n$13$\n$20$\n$23$\n$8$\n$4$\n$50$\n$14$\n$18$\n$24$\n$7$\n$5$\n$45$\n$15$\n$16$\n$25$\n$6$\n$6$\n$40$\n$16$\n$15$\n$26$\n$5$\n$7$\n$36$\n$17$\n$14$\n$27$\n$4$\n$8$\n$32$\n$18$\n$13$\n$28$\n$3$\n$9$\n$29$\n$19$\n$12$\n$29$\n$2$\n$10$\n$26$\n$20$\n$11$\n$30$\n$1$\nIf a contestant gets a worse rank than $30$, they get $0$ points. If two or more contestants get the same rank in the contest, they are instead assigned the average points of all the corresponding ranks. This average is always rounded up to the closest integer. For example, if three contestants are tied for second place they all receive $\\lceil \\frac{75 + 60 + 50}{3} \\rceil = 62$ points, and the next contestant will have rank $5$ and receives $45$ points (or less, if there is a tie also for $5$\u2019th place). This applies also at rank $30$, e.g., if $4711$ contestants are tied for $30$\u2019th place, they all receive $1$ point.\nContestants may participate in every contest either on-site or online. If they compete on-site, they get $1$ extra point, no matter their original number of points.

Headmistress Umbridge knows this, and she also knows that knowledge is power. She has collected data on all of the $n$ students at the school, asking each of them who they are friends with. Now she has a list of responses, but she is suspicious that some of the students might not have been entirely truthful during the questioning.\nFrom anonymous (but highly reliable) sources, Headmistress Umbridge knows that the friendships at her school satisfy the following properties:\n - If $a$ is friends with $b$ then $b$ is also friends with $a$.\n - The set of students can be partitioned into groups, such that every student participates in exactly one group, where\n - each group has at least one and at most $p$ students, and\n - for each group there are at most $q$ pairs of friends with the first one in the group, and the second one outside of it.\nNote that two students in the same group do not have to be friends.\nUmbridge has hired you to figure out whether it is possible that all students are telling the truth, or whether she can be sure that at least one student is lying, and that she therefore should put everyone in detention. Is this morally questionable? Probably.\n(In case the students may be telling the truth, you are worried that her suspicion might fall on you instead; thus you will also want to provide evidence of a valid partition if there is one.)\n-----Input-----\nFirst a single line with three non-negative integers $n$, $p$ and $q$ as described above. Next follow $n$ lines, one for each student, starting with student $i=0$. Each such line starts with an integer $m_ i$, denoting the number of friends student number $i$ claims that she has. Then follow $m_ i$ distinct integers between $0$ and $n-1$, indicating who those friends are (the students are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$).\nWe always have $1 \\leq n \\leq 2500$, and $p + q \\leq 15$. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that $m_0 + m_1 + \\ldots + m_{n-1} \\leq 30000$.

If you output home on the first line, then you should prove your claim by outputting a partition of the students into groups such that the requirements above hold (if there are several, any one will do): The second line should then contain a positive integer $G$, the number of groups. The following $G$ lines should each begin with a positive integer $g_ i$, the number of students in the $i$-th group.

This app will allow them to keep track of who encountered an expense and how it should be shared with others through the form of IOUs. For instance, if Alice pays for a meal shared with Bob and Carol, and Bob\u2019s and Carol\u2019s shares were $\\$ 5$ and $\\$ 10$, respectively, then Bob would issue an IOU for $\\$ 5$ to Alice and Carol would issue an IOU for $\\$ 10$ to Alice.\nYour app will maintain a ledger of who owes whom.

If there are multiple ways in which cancelation can occur, you may choose any of them as long as there are no cycles left at the end.

Since the upgrade will take some time, he will peruse the services of the company ACM (Association of Computer Maintenance) that provides storage servers for him to temporarily store his data.\nAlthough ACM offers storage servers of any size, ACM wants to encourage more bulk purchases of servers of the same size as this saves cost. The cost of purchasing a set of storage servers that can each store $M$ bytes consists of a base cost of $M$ dollars plus $1$ dollar for every server of that size purchased.\nMr. Panda wants to store a total of $K$ bytes of data and in order to easily track the servers, he wants to purchase a set of storage servers of the same size to store the $K$ bytes of data using the least cost. However, Mr. Panda feels compelled not to waste any space. Thus, he requires that the total storage space of the servers purchased must be exactly $K$ bytes.\nAs storage space of technology increases exponentially with time, $K$ can be very large. You are given the prime factorization of $K$. Help Mr. Panda calculate the minimum cost required to store his data. As the minimum cost can be quite large, print the minimum cost modulo a prime number $10^9+7$.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of one line with a string of even length consisting of at most $700$ representing the prime factorization of $K$. Every pair of two consecutive digits, starting from the first two digits, represents one prime factor. So input of length $N$ will have $N/2$ prime factors.\nIt is guaranteed that all the prime factors given are prime and that $K$ has at most $10^{10}$ divisors. Each prime factor will appear at most $100$ times.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the minimum cost in one line as a single integer.Sample Data Explanation\nIn the first example, $K = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 12$, so buy three servers with $M = 4$ bytes. Mr. Panda pays $4$ dollars base cost plus $3$ dollars for three servers purchased, or a total of $4+3 = 7$ dollars. Mr. Panda can also buy four servers with $M = 3$ bytes with the same cost of $7$ dollars.\nIn the second example, $K = 13 \\cdot 11 = 143$, so buy eleven servers with $M = 13$ bytes. Mr. Panda pays $13$ dollars base cost plus $11$ dollars for eleven servers purchased, or a total $13+11 = 24$ dollars. Mr. Panda can also buy thirteen servers with $M = 11$ bytes with the same cost of $24$ dollars.\nIn the third example, $K = 11$, so buy one server with $M = 11$ bytes. Mr. Panda pays $11$ dollars base cost plus $1$ dollar for one server purchased, or a total $11+1 = 12$ dollars. Note that although he can get a cheaper cost if he were able to purchase storage servers of different sizes, he cannot do so.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n020302\nSample Output 1:\n7\nSample Input 2:\n1311\nSample Output 2:\n24\n\ndef",

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nGold Leaf is a very thin layer of gold, with a paper backing. If the paper gets folded and then unfolded, the gold leaf will stick to itself more readily than it will stick to the paper, so there will be patches of gold and patches of exposed paper. Note that the gold leaf will always stick to itself, rather than the paper. In the following example, the paper was folded along the dashed line. Notice how the gold leaf always sticks to one side or the other, never both.\nConsider a crude digital image of a sheet of gold leaf. If the area covered by a pixel is mostly gold, that will be represented by a \u2018#\u2019. If it\u2019s mostly exposed paper, it will be represented by a \u2018.\u2019. Determine where the sheet was folded. The sheet was folded exactly once, along a horizontal, vertical, or 45 degree or 135 degree diagonal line. If the fold is horizontal or vertical, it is always between rows/columns. If the fold is diagonal, then the fold goes through a diagonal line of cells, and the cells along the fold are always \u2018#\u2019.\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will begin with a line with two integers, $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n, m \\le 25$), where $n$ is the number of rows, and $m$ is the number of columns of the image. Each of the next $n$ lines will contain exactly $m$ characters, all of which will be either \u2018#\u2019 or \u2018.\u2019. This represents a crudely collected digital image of the sheet of gold leaf. There is guaranteed to be at least one \u2018.\u2019, and there is guaranteed to be a solution.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with four integers, indicating the places where the fold hits the edges of the paper. Output them in this order:\n    r1 c1 r2 c2\nwhere $(r1,c1)$ and $(r2,c2)$ are row/column coordinates ($r$=row, $c$=column). The top left character of the image is $(1,1)$ and the bottom right is $(n,m)$.\nIf the fold is horizontal or diagonal, list the left coordinates before the right. If the fold is vertical, list the top coordinates before the bottom.\nIf the fold is horizontal, use the coordinates above the fold. If the fold is vertical, use the coordinates to the left of the fold. If the fold is diagonal, use the coordinates of the edge pixels that the fold goes through.\nIf more than one fold is possible, choose the one with the smallest first coordinate, then the smallest second coordinate, then third, then fourth.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n8 10\n#.#..##..#\n####..####\n###.##....\n...#..####\n....##....\n.#.##..##.\n##########\n##########\nSample Output 1:\n3 1 3 10\nSample Input 2:\n5 20\n###########.#.#.#.#.\n###########...#.###.\n##########..##.#..##\n###########..#.#.##.\n###########.###...#.\nSample Output 2:\n1 15 5 15\n\ndef",

All $k$ positions on its council are open, and as usual Notnomde and Yraglac are the only ones running for each position.\nHaving long since abandoned quaint majority voting, Binary Town uses binary voting instead. In binary voting, all $v$ voters can cast any number of ballots, or not vote at all. The $k^\\mathrm {th}$ least significant bits of the total number of ballots are then used to determine which candidate wins each position. That is, Notnomde wins position $j$ if the $j^\\mathrm {th}$ least significant bit of the total number of ballots is $0$, otherwise Yraglac wins.\nYou know your neighbours well, and know exactly how many ballots $b_ i$ each one will cast if they choose to vote. For some reason, not everyone is happy with the electoral system so not everyone votes. Thankfully, you also know the probability $p_ i$ of each citizen voting.\nSince you like Yraglac more than Notnomde, you want to cast the number of ballots which maximizes the expected number of positions held by Yraglac.\nSuppose there are $k = 2$ positions and $v = 2$ voters, and you know with $50\\% $ probability that the voter other than yourself will cast one ballot. If you cast one ballot, the total number of ballots could be $01_2$ or $10_2$ with equal probability, so the expected number of positions for Yraglac is $1$.

After these appetizers, it was the perfect time to whip up a deep pot full of sarma (Melita ate twentyish of them) as well as a large platter of fine roast pork, so soft that it almost melts in your mouth.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nA number of regional Internet Service Providers (ISPs), both big and small have recently been forced into a merger by the government, in an effort to improve service for all. Of course this has been decided without consulting you, the chief network infrastructure officer, and a deadline for when the ISPs should be merged have already been set.\nYou have a set of $n$ servers, each with a limited number of network sockets that can be used for connecting physically to other servers. Some servers are already linked up in the existing network architecture, and if server 0 is linked to server 2, then 2 is also linked to server 0 (as you use full duplex ethernet Cat6 cables). No server is directly connected to itself, and no two servers are directly linked with more than one connection.\nYou want to connect the servers to form a single network, such that all servers can reach each other through some sequence of connections. To make the set deadline, you have estimated that you only have time to make $k$ edits to the existing network infrastructure. An edit is either to remove an existing connection between two servers, or to add a new connection between two servers.\nCan you connect all the servers to the same network using at most $k$ edits, within the limitations on the number of network sockets in each server?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input is three space separated integers $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100000$), the number of servers, $m$ ($0 \\leq m \\leq 200000$), the number of existing connections and $k$ ($0 \\leq k \\leq 50000$), the number of edits you have time to make. Then follows a line with $n$ integers $c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_ i, \\ldots, c_{n-1}$, with the $i$\u2019th number giving the number of network sockets for the $i$\u2019th server (for all $i$ the capacity is bounded by $1 \\leq c_ i < n$). Then $m$ lines follow, with two integers $u_ j$ and $v_ j$ each, giving the id\u2019s of two servers that are connected in the old network architecture. Servers are $0$-indexed, i.e. for every $j$, it holds that $0 \\leq u_ j, v_ j < n$. A server will never be connected to more servers than it has connection sockets.\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u201cyes\u201d on a single line if the servers can be connected to one network by making $k$ or less edits, and \u201cno\u201d if it is not possible.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 5 2\n3 3 3 3\n0 1\n0 3\n1 3\n1 2\n2 3\nSample Output 1:\nyes\nSample Input 2:\n5 4 4\n1 1 2 2 2\n0 1\n2 3\n3 4\n4 2\nSample Output 2:\nyes\n\ndef",

It\u2019s terminal based, but a bit friendlier to new users who can\u2019t remember the commands they typed before. Fish can use your history of commands for command completion: pressing up (\u201c^\u201d) finds the last command you ran that shares the prefix you have already typed (a string is a prefix of itself).\nIf you press up again you go another step back in time, finding the second last command that shares the prefix of what you typed. If there are no more matching commands you stay at the oldest matching command.\nWhen a series of consecutive up-presses is ended, either by typing some other character or by pressing enter to run the current command, the matching command from the history replaces everything that was typed in the current input.\nWhen you press enter the current input is added to the command history. The command history does not contain up-characters (\u201c^\u201d) since command completion is always performed before the enter-key is processed.\nThe input to this problem contains the characters a user typed in a fish terminal, separated into lines. After each line, the user pressed enter. Your task is to output the resulting command history.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single number $n$, where $1 \\leq n \\leq 100000$.\nThen follows $n$ lines with the user input. Each line consists of characters from the alphabet $\\big [$a-zA-Z0-9.^-$\\big ]$, i.e. English lower and upper case letters, digits, \u201c-\u201d, \u201c \u201d, \u201c.\u201d and the symbol \u201c^\u201d denoting the up key. No command begins or ends with a space.\nThe input is guaranteed to contain at most $10^6$ characters.\n-----Output-----\nFor each command in the input output a line with the completed command (where all \u201c^\u201d are expanded). The total amount of output is guaranteed to be at most $10^6$ characters.\n-----Sample Explanation-----\nIn Sample Input $1$ your first command is \u201cpython\u201d. Your next command gets auto completed to \u201cpython\u201d, and then you write \u201c main.py\u201d, which is appended to your command making \u201cpython main.py\u201d. The last command completes the first up press to \u201cpython main.py\u201d, then \u201c -n 10\u201d is typed which becomes \u201cpython main.py -n 10\u201d.\nIn Sample Input $2$ your first two commands are \u201cpython\u201d and \u201cjava\u201d. The third command becomes auto completed to java, your previous command. The fourth command completes to \u201cpython\u201d since it was your third last command. For your fifth command the third last command auto completed is now \u201cjava\u201d.\nIn Sample Input $3$ no commands are in your history, so your up presses have no effect and only the non up presses count to your command making \u201cpython\u201d.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\npython\np^ main.py\n^ -n 10\nSample Output 1:\npython\npython main.py\npython main.py -n 10\nSample Input 2:\n5\npython\njava\n^\n^^^\n^^^\nSample Output 2:\npython\njava\njava\npython\njava\n\ndef",

Even in a head-on collision the ship can be saved by a system of bulkheads, reinforced vertical sections inside the structure designed to prevent ingressed water from spreading to other sections.\nA splendid new ship of the line has had a team of talented artists hard at work reticulating the finest splines for use in this vessel. However, not being concerned with such details, they have left out the placements of the bulkheads as an exercise for their readers.\nThis is where you can help. First, we need to find how many bulkheads we can fit in the ship. Second, the exact placements of the bulkheads need to be found.\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing an integer $C$ ($10 \\le C \\le 10^9$), the minimum area of a bulkhead section.\n - One line containing an integer $N$ ($3 \\le N \\le 10^5$), the number of vertices in the artists\u2019 design for the boat.\n - $N$ unique lines, each containing two integers: $x$ and $y$ ($-10^5 \\le x, y \\le 10^5$), the coordinates of the vertices from the hull in counter-clockwise winding order.\nThe shape of the boat never doubles back on itself horizontally; that is to say, if a vertical line is drawn through the cross-section, no matter where, it will always pass through the boat exactly once\u2014never twice\u2014however it may run along one or more edges.\nIt is guaranteed that it is always possible to fit at least one bulkhead section into the ship.\n-----Output-----\n - One line containing one integer, $M$: the maximum number of bulkhead sections that can be created. It is guaranteed that $M$ is between $1$ and $100$.\n - $M-1$ lines, each containing one real number: the $X$-coordinate of the placement of a bulkhead such that the sections defined by it have equal area to all the others. Bulkhead placements must be given in increasing order of $X$.\nAll output must be accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n50\n4\n110 10\n80 10\n80 0\n110 0\nSample Output 1:\n6\n85\n90\n95\n100\n105\nSample Input 2:\n24\n3\n10 10\n30 10\n20 20\nSample Output 2:\n4\n17.071067\n20\n22.928932\n\ndef",
