They want to install traffic drones at different intersections to observe who\u2019s running on a red light. If a car runs a red light, the drone will chase and stop the car to give the driver an appropriate ticket. The drones are quite stupid, however, and a drone will stop before it comes to the next intersection as it might otherwise lose its way home, its home being the traffic light to which it is assigned. The drones are not able to detect the presence of other drones, so the police\u2019s R&D department found out that if a drone was placed at some intersection, then it was best not to put any drones at any of the neighbouring intersections. As is usual in many cities, there are no intersections in Basin City with more than four other neighbouring intersections.\nThe drones are government funded, so the police force would like to buy as many drones as they are allowed to. Being the programmer-go-to for the Basin City Police Department, they ask you to decide, for a given number of drones, whether it is feasible to position exactly this number of drones.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $k$ ($0 \\leq k \\leq 15$), giving the number of drones to position. Then follows one line with $1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\; 000$, the total number of intersections in Basin City. Finally follow\u00a0$n$ lines describing consecutive intersections. The $i$-th line describes the $i$-th intersection in the following format: The line starts with one integer $d$ ($0 \\leq d \\leq 4$) describing the number of intersections neighbouring the $i$-th one. Then follow $d$ integers denoting the indices of these neighbouring intersections. They will be all distinct and different from $i$. The intersections are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible to position $k$ drones such that no two neighbouring intersections have been assigned a drone, output a single line containing possible.

So they decide to hire a messenger. Since the cost of the messenger service depends on the time it takes to deliver the package, they need your help to optimize a little bit.\nAssume Misha and Nadia move on a two-dimensional plane, each visiting a sequence of places and moving along straight line segments from place to place. Your task is to find the shortest possible delivery time given their two paths.\nMisha hands the package to the messenger at some point along his path. The messenger moves without delay along a straight line from the pick-up to intercept Nadia, who is traveling along her path. Misha, Nadia and the messenger move with a constant speed of $1$ distance unit per time unit. The delivery time is the time between Misha handing over the package and Nadia receiving it.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The test case contains two path descriptions, the first for Misha and the second for Nadia. Each path description starts with a line containing an integer $n$, the number of places visited ($2 \\leq n \\leq 50000$). This is followed by $n$ lines, each with two integers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ specifying the coordinates of a place ($0 \\leq x_ i, y_ i \\leq 30000$). Coordinates of the places are listed in the order in which they are to be visited, and successive places do not have the same coordinates.\nMisha and Nadia start their journeys at the same time, visiting the places along their paths without stopping. The length of each path is at most $10^6$. The package must be picked up at the latest when Misha reaches his final place and it must be delivered at the latest when Nadia reaches her final place.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the minimal time needed for delivery.

Write a program to help the organizers determine a way to match up the translators in pairs, so that each of the translators speaks a language that the other also speaks.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two numbers $N$ and $M$, the number of languages spoken at the convention, and the number of hired translators respectively ($2 \\leq N \\leq 100$, $1 \\leq M \\leq 200$).\nThe following $M$ lines each describe a translator.

In this project, a wireless sensor network in the Amazon rainforest gathers environmental information. The Amazon rainforest stores an amount of carbon equivalent to a decade of global fossil fuel emissions, and it plays a crucial role in the world\u2019s oxygen-transfer processes. Because of the huge size of this forest, changes in the forest affect not only the local environment but also global climate by altering wind and ocean current patterns. The goal of the ACM project is to help scientists better understand earth\u2019s complex ecosystems and the impact of human activities.\nSamantha has an important hypothesis and to test her hypothesis, she needs to find a subset of sensors in which each pair of sensors can communicate directly with each other. A sensor can communicate directly with any other sensor having distance at most $d$ from it. In order for her experiments to be as accurate as possible, Samantha wants to choose as many sensors as possible.\nAs one does not simply walk into the Amazon, Samantha cannot add new sensors or move those that are currently in place.

It\u2019s considered a high-level language and is typically interpreted (rather than compiled). For this problem, write an interpreter for a restricted dialect of BASIC. Here is a description of the language.\nEach input line contains one statement. Each statement begins with a non-negative integer, which we will call its label. Following the label is a single space and one of the following commands (with explanations following):\n - LET X = <ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT>\n Assign the result of the arithmetic statement to variable X.\n - IF <CONDITION> THEN GOTO L\n If the boolean given is true, then go to the statement labeled L, where L is a valid label. (If the condition is not true, continue execution to the statement with the next lowest label.)\n - PRINT <PRINT_STATEMENT>\n Produce output, without an appended newline.\n - PRINTLN <PRINT_STATEMENT>\n Produce output, with an appended newline.\nHere are details on types, variables, and the terms <ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT>, <CONDITION>, and <PRINT_STATEMENT> used above.\n - All numeric values (in the input and for the variable representation) are signed 32-bit integers.\n - All variables are single uppercase characters (A through Z). They are all global in scope, and are all initialized to zero before program execution begins.\n - <ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT> is one of the following: X, X + Y, X - Y, X * Y, or X / Y. Here, X and Y each indicate either a variable or an integer.\n - <CONDITION> is one of the following: X = Y, X > Y, X < Y, X <> Y, X <= Y, or X >= Y. Again, X and Y each indicate either a variable or an integer. Here, <> indicates inequality.\n - <PRINT_STATEMENT> is either a variable name or a literal string delimited by double quotes. Inside the quotes, the string contains only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and spaces.\nIn the signed 32-bit arithmetic, the usual rules of truncation towards zero (for division) and overflow (for addition and multiplication) and underflow (for subtraction) apply. The following examples illustrate these conditions:\n5 / 2   = 2  65536 * 32768   = -2147483648\n-1 / 2  = 0  -65536 * 32768  = -2147483648\n2147483647 + 1  = -2147483648        -2147483648 * 2 = 0\n-2147483648 - 1 = 2147483647 2147483647 * 2  = -2\nFurther, division by zero will not occur.\nProgram execution begins with the statement having the smallest label, and proceeds with the statement having the next smallest label. (Unless a GOTO executes, in which case execution proceeds at the designated label.) The program halts after it has completed the statement with the largest label (which is guaranteed not to contain a GOTO).\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a single program. Each line contains a single valid statement. Each pair of adjacent tokens in the input is separated by a single space. Integers in the input will all be in the range $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$.

One of the trees grew from the left, and the other from the right. On $n$ points, they collided.\nNumbering the points $1, 2, \\dots, n$ from left to right, the left tree ended up connecting all of them in a single subtree rooted in node $1$, such that every node\u2019s children had larger numbers than the node itself. We can describe this subtree with a list of $n-1$ edges.\nSimilarly, the right tree also connected all nodes in a single subtree rooted in node $n$, with every node\u2019s children having smaller numbers than the node itself. This yields an additional $n-1$ edges.\nNow, given the full list of $2(n-1)$ edges, it is not necessarily easy to tell which edge belongs to which tree. Can you figure out a possible assignment, or determine that it is impossible for this collection to have been the union of two trees?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$).

A pair $(u, v)$ may be connected by more than one edge.\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible for the edges to be the union of two trees that grow left-to-right and right-to-left, output a string of length $2(n-1)$, where the $i$\u2019s character is L if the $i$\u2019th edge should come from the left tree, or R if it should come from the right tree. Otherwise, output the word \u201cimpossible\u201d on a single line.

As she lives along the Atlantic coast she knows that this means a larger variation in the tide compared to first and last quarter. With no rain in the air, it seemed like a perfect week for walks at the beach by the cliffs.\nThe tide is dangerous when walking at the beach between the sea and the cliff wall. As the water rises, you may get trapped. Therefore it is important to plan the walk according to the behaviour of the tide.\nOne simple way of cliff walk planning is just to start walking and turn around at low tide. The problem is that on a rocky beach, you want the rocks to dry for one hour before entering them. It could therefore actually be safe to continue the walk a bit further even after low tide. Note that the beach is mostly made of sand and the rocks have many cracks in them, so we assume that all areas are flooded or drained at the exact moment when the tide reaches their height, irrespective of the heights of the neighbouring areas.\nThe beach has been surveyed and a map is available where each $10\\times 10$m square has a certain height. Each square can only be entered from the four neighbouring squares to the north, south, east and west. It is only possible to pass between two squares of height $z_1, z_2$ if the absolute height difference $|z_1 - z_2|$ is at most $1$ meter. Charlotte walks in such a way that it takes a constant amount of time to pass from one square to another and during the whole time period both squares must be dry.\nThe tide behaves differently at different places on the Earth depending on the sea bottom, coast line etc. Charlotte knows that it is possible to approximate the tide\u2019s water level $v$ as $v = 0.5a\\cdot (\\cos (t\\frac{2\\pi }{12})+1)$, where $t$ is time in hours since the last high tide and $a$ is a number depending on the location, time of the year, etc.\nCharlotte will start and finish her walk at her home. She limits her time away from home to only one tide interval, so you may assume that $0.0 \\leq t \\leq 12.0$. How far from home is she able to get and still return safely back?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two floating point numbers $a$, $0.0 < a < 15.0$, and $m$, $0.1 \\leq m \\leq 60.0$, the number of seconds it takes to pass one square on the map. The second line contains four integers $W$, $H$, $X$ and $Y$ where $1 \\le W,H \\le 200$, $0 \\le X < W$ and $0 \\le Y < H$. $W$ and $H$ are the width and height of the map of the coast, $X$ and $Y$ describes the coordinate $(X, Y)$ of Charlotte\u2019s home.\nThen follow $H$ lines each containing $W$ space separated integers, describing the height in millimetres of each $10\\times 10$m surveyed square compared to extreme low tide. You can assume that the height of each square will be at least $0$ and at most $20000$ milimetres. The first number on the first line corresponds to coordinate $(0, 0)$. Charlotte\u2019s home will always be dry.\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line with the maximum Euclidean distance that Charlotte can get from home. The distance between two squares should be measured between their centers. The answer is considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.\nTo avoid problems with floating point numbers, the result is guaranteed to be the same for all walking speeds $m\u2019$ where $0.999 m < m\u2019 < 1.001 m$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2.0 10.0\n3 3 0 0\n2001 1000 100\n1001 10000 200\n100 0 0\nSample Output:\n20\n\ndef",

Archeologists have made findings which indicate that already in the Middle Ages, infantry were practicing for programming contests while not in battle. Although it is not known how the programming contests were carried out (there were no computers), the archeologists have come up with a good theory (according to them). It states that infantry submitted pseudocode carved into stone, and then by the end of the contest, a genius priest named K\u00e1tisse ran all the programs in her head for correction. How they know her name? They won\u2019t say. \nOne of the reasons for this somewhat peculiar theory was the finding of ancient pike, a combat spear. Scientists have found many of these throughout the years. They come with a special symbol carved into them, usually the symbol of the tribe. This one didn\u2019t have a symbol carved into it, it had pseudo code for Fenwick trees, as well as a config file for some kind of editor. Scientists are unsure which editor it might have been, but they believe it was some version of the closed Emacs beta.\nInstead of looking for more evidence, the archeologists started speculating what strategy the pikemen used in these programming contests. They must have been well prepared, since this guy had algorithms carved into his spear. The contest rules were probably as follows: When submiting a solution to the judge, the time in minutes from contest start was added to a penalty counter. So in order to plan his problem solving, a pikeman must have been good at approximating the number of minutes required to solve each problem.\nYou are given a number of problems which were designed for a contest in which the pikeman participated. For each problem, you are given the estimated time in minutes for solving the problem. Calculate the maximum number of problems a pikeman can solve in the contest, and the minimum penalty he can get, under the assumptions that these estimations are correct. You may assume that the pikemen are very efficient: submissions are always correct, and after submitting a problem they start solving the next problem immediately.\n-----Input-----\nInput starts with two integers on a single line $1 \\le N \\le 10^9$ and $ 1 \\le T \\le 10^{18}$, the number of problems in the ancient contest and the total length of the contest in minutes.

The ball bounces around the grid until it eventually hits one of the targets. The player earns a certain number of points depending on which target is hit.\nThe grid pattern for the next Pachinko machine has already been designed, but point values for the targets have not been assigned. These must be set so that like all casino machines, the machine is profitable but not too profitable. Thus it is important to figure out the probability of a ball hitting any particular target. That\u2019s your job!\nFor simplicity, the grid is modeled as a tall rectangle filled with mostly-open spaces (each represented by \u2018.\u2019), impassable obstacles (each represented by \u2018X\u2019), and targets (each represented by \u2018T\u2019).\nA ball is launched randomly with uniform probability into one of the mostly-open spaces on the top row of the grid. From that point on, collisions with pegs cause the ball to randomly bounce up, down, left, or right, with various given probabilities. For simplicity, assume these probabilities are the same for every space in the grid. If the ball bounces into an obstacle or attempts to move off the grid, it won\u2019t actually move from its current space. When the ball moves into a target it is removed from play.\nYou can safely assume that the average number of spaces visited by a ball before hitting a target will not exceed $10^{9}$. It would not make for a very enjoyable game if the ball just bounces forever!\nFor each target, calculate the probability that it is the one hit by a launched ball.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line contains integers $w$ and $h$, which are the width and height of the Pachinko grid ($1 \\leq w \\leq 20$ and $2 \\leq h \\leq 10000$). The next line contains four non-negative integers $u$, $d$, $l$, and $r$, which sum to 100 and are the percentage probabilities of the ball bouncing up, down, left, or right from any open space.\nEach of the next $h$ lines contains $w$ characters, each of which is \u2018.\u2019, \u2018X\u2019, or \u2018T\u2019. These lines describe the Pachinko grid. The first line, which describes the top row of the grid, contains at least one \u2018.\u2019 and no \u2018T\u2019s.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay one line for each \u2018T\u2019 in the grid, in order from top to bottom, breaking ties left to right.

You need to modify $s_1$ into $s_2$ as quickly as possible. The trick is that you are allowed to modify the strings only using the following types of moves: (1) shift forward where you choose a substring of one of the strings and shift each of its letters by 1 forward in the alphabet, or (2) shift backward where you shift each letter in a substring backward in the alphabet. The first move is not allowed if the substring contains the letter z while the second move is not allowed if the subtring contains a. What is the smallest number of moves you need to modify $s_1$ into $s_2$?\n-----Input-----\nEach word puzzle is described on a single line that contains the strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ separated by space. The strings contain only lower case letters.

First shift lo forward, getting helmp. Then shift h forward 12 times, getting telmp. Then shift l 11 times backward to get teamp and then shift p forward three times to get teams. Total number of moves is $1+12+11+3=27$.\nThe second sample input can be modified as follows. First shift the entire string forward, getting bbdddbbbb. Then shift ddd backward twice to get bbbbbbbbb.

All beacons within sight of these are then lit, and so on until all beacons are lit - assuming of course that all beacons are within sight of each other, directly or indirectly. If they are not, the dire news must be carried by riders between some beacons.\nGiven the location of all beacons in the kingdom as well as the location and size of all mountain peaks, write a program that determines how many messages must be sent by riders in order for all beacons to be lit when an enemy threatens the country.\nFor simplicity, we model the country in the following way: a beacon is represented as a point in the xy-plane and a mountain peak is represented as a circle. Two beacons are considered to be within sight of each other if no mountain peak blocks the straight line between the two beacons.\nThe input will be constructed so that the straight line between any pair of beacons will not touch the circumference of a mountain peak, unless it passes through the interior of another mountain peak.

Anton has to place three identical sensors along the mountain range, which can be modeled as a one-dimensional number line.\nA lot of snow fell during the winter, and the sensors need to be placed at points with an ascending order of snow levels, since they work best arranged that way.

For example, if $n=m=2$ for a $2\\! \\times \\! 2$ grid, Bob only has to place $1$ obstacle, but there are $4$ ways to place it, so the answer in this case is $4$.\n-----Input-----\nThe single line of input contains three space-separated integers $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 25$), $m$ ($2 \\leq m \\leq 10^3$) and $p$ ($10^8 \\leq p \\leq 10^9+7$, $p$ is a prime number), where Alice\u2019s grid is of size $n\\! \\times \\! m$, and $p$ is a large prime modulus.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, which is the number of ways Bob can place the minimum number of obstacles in the $n\\! \\times \\! m$ grid to prevent Alice from placing her $2 \\! \\times \\! 2$ block. Since this may be very large, output it modulo $p$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 4 999999937\nSample Output:\n79\n\ndef",

This is going to have bad consequences for Mr. Bourgeois\u2019 company, which just approved the way new salaries will be calculated. The company has $N$ workers and the salary for worker $i$ is going to be determined as a number drawn uniformly from the range $[L_ i, R_ i]$. Since the company already figured out which workers are the most efficient ones, for each $i$ in $[2, N]$, we know that $L_{i-1} \\leq L_ i$ and $R_{i-1} \\leq R_ i$, but note that as a result of chance, worker $i-1$ might still end up with a larger salary than worker $i$.\nThe new government introduced a law, where any worker who got a smaller salary than a coworker can sue the company for the amount of their difference. What\u2019s even more atrocious is that they can do it for every worker who got a larger salary. So if there were three employees: Alice, Bob, and Charlie, who got salaries of $1$, $3$, and $7$ coins respectively, then employee Bob can sue with regards to Charlie for $4$ coins, while Alice can sue for $2$ coins because of Bob and for $6$ coins because of Charlie. The total amount of damages the company will have to pay is $12$.\nWhile the exact salary amounts are not known yet, Mr. Bourgeois would like to find out the expected amount of damages that his company will have to pay.

Thanks to state-of-the-art prediction methods, Amazin\u2019 now knows in advance how many workers will be needed each day for the foreseeable future. Using this information they can adjust the size of their workforce on a day-to-day basis by firing and/or hiring workers so that they always have exactly as many as are needed each day. In order to prevent the workers from getting too comfortable and organizing themselves, they will also regularly fire workers and replace them with new ones. For instance, if on some day four more workers are needed than yesterday, Amazin\u2019 might fire $10$ people and then hire $14$ new ones on that day. \nUnfortunately, due to labor laws, the firing of workers must follow a last-in-first-out order: the people who have been employed the shortest time must be fired first. Furthermore, a fired person cannot be re-hired within the foreseeable future so it is not possible to circumvent the law by firing some people and then immediately re-hiring some of them.\nBut this story is actually about HR, not workers! Every day, one employee from the HR department is assigned to be responsible for giving the fired workers the bad news that they are fired, and for then giving the newly hired workers the good news that they are hired. In order to minimize work environment problems in the form of social awkwardness for the HR staff, a policy has been established requiring that the HR person firing an employee must always be a different HR person than the one welcoming them when they were hired.\nNow the time has come for the HR department to also optimize itself, by making itself as small as possible. Unlike workers, new HR staff cannot be hired with short notice, so the HR personnel must be permanent employees. What is the smallest number of HR people needed in order to manage all the planned hirings and firings?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$), the length in days of the foreseeable future. Then follow $n$ lines, the $i$th of which contains two integers $f_ i$ and $h_ i$ ($0 \\le f_ i, h_ i \\le 10^6$) where $f_ i$ is the number of workers fired on day $i$ and $h_ i$ the number of people hired.\nThe number of workers fired on a day is never larger than the number of currently employed workers (in other words, $f_ i \\le \\sum _{j=0}^{i-1} h_ j-f_ j$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$).\n-----Output-----\nOutput a line with an integer $k$, the smallest number of HR people needed.

Their lives were thus much more boring than those of today\u2019s young adults. How could you even survive back then, you might ask yourself. The answer is simple: you write down numbers on pieces of paper! Our two cohabitants loved writing integers on papers, and often had huge piles of them each afternoon. To avoid filling their entire living room with integers, Beata challenged her friend to a game every evening to determine who should take the trash out \u2013 the Guessing Circle game.\nThe Guessing Circle game is played by two players (in our case, Alf and Beata) using a large circle of $n$ pieces of papers, each paper labelled with some integer. Alf starts by choosing an integer $x$ that appears on some piece of paper. Beata then tries to figure out what this integer is by asking a series of questions. In each question, Beata picks an integer $y$ that appears on a piece of paper and asks if $y$ is closest to $x$ on the circle when going clockwise or counter-clockwise (measured in the number of pieces of paper between them). If both directions give the same distance, for instance if $y = x$, Alf can choose which one of the two possible answers to provide.\nThey had initially agreed that no two pieces of paper may have the same integer written on them, but Alf found this hugely unfair \u2013 it was quite easy for Beata to figure out $x$. Instead, he suggested a variant where some integers can appear multiple times in the circle. When providing the answer to a question $y$ from Beata, he is instead allowed to choose any pair of papers on which $x$ and $y$ appear, and give his answer for these two papers.\nBeata reluctantly agreed to play the new variant, as long as Alf promises to choose an integer in the circle such that Beata can eventually figure it out. Knowing which these integers are turned out to be quite a tricky task for Alf, and he often had to spend hours before the game proving that Beata would be able to deduce which number he had chosen. Write a program to help Alf determine which numbers he can choose.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of integers contains $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 15000$), the number of pieces of paper in the circle.

If the square is ice however, the player will first be transferred into that square, and then repeat the procedure again in the same direction. This means the player will glide on the ice until either colliding with an obstacle or reaching a square filled with gravel. Gliding on ice counts only as one move.\nYou have almost finished your level design. In the maze, there is a goal square that you wish to reach. You still have to choose a square to be the starting point of the player. Since you do not want the level to be too easy, you want to make sure the number of moves needed to get from the starting point to the goal is sufficiently high.\nCan you compute the minimum number of moves needed to get from each point in the maze to the goal? Note that move may result in the player traveling multiple squares if gliding on the ice.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains the two integers $3 \\le C \\le 1000$ and $3 \\le R \\le 1000$, the number of columns and rows that the maze consists of.\nThe next $R$ lines contains $C$ characters each, describing the maze. Each square in the maze is represented by one of the following characters:\n - a period (.) represents a gravel square\n - a pound sign (#) represents an obstacle\n - an underscore (_) represents an ice square\n - an M (M) represents the goal in the maze, which is also covered in gravel\nThe edges of the maze are always surrounded by obstacle squares.\n-----Output-----\nOutput $R$ lines with $C$ integers each, one for each square, containing the number of moves needed to reach the goal.\nIf it is not possible to reach the target from a square, output $-1$ instead for that square.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 6\n#####\n#...#\n#_###\n#_M.#\n#__.#\n#####\nSample Output:\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 4 5 6 -1\n-1 4 -1 -1 -1\n-1 1 0 1 -1\n-1 3 1 2 -1\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\ndef",

Some pairs of buildings in the city can be directly connected with a wire telephone line and the municipality engineers have prepared an estimate of the cost of connecting any such pair.\nThe mayor needs your help to find the cheapest network that connects all buildings in the city and satisfies a particular security measure that will be explained shortly. A call from a building $A$ to another building $B$ may be routed through any simple path in the network (i.e., a path that does not have any repeated building). There are also some insecure buildings that one or more persons with serious criminal records live in. The mayor wants only communications intended for these insecure buildings to reach them. In other words, no communication from any building $A$ to any building $B$ should pass through any insecure building $C$ in the network (where $C$ is different from $A$ and $B$).\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $p$ where $1 \\le n \\le 1000$ is the number of buildings, $0 \\le m \\le 100000$ is the number of possible direct connections between a pair of buildings, and $0 \\le p \\le n$ is the number of insecure buildings. The buildings are numbered from $1$ to $n$. The second line contains $p$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$ (inclusive), which are the numbers of insecure buildings. Each of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $x_ i$, $y_ i$, and $\\ell _ i$ describing one potential direct line, where $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ $(1 \\le x_ i, y_ i \\le n)$ are the distinct buildings the line connects, and $\\ell _ i$ $(1 \\le \\ell _ i \\le 10000)$ is the estimate of the cost of connecting these buildings. There is at most one direct link between any two buildings in these $m$ lines.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the cost of the cheapest network satisfying the security measure if it is possible.
