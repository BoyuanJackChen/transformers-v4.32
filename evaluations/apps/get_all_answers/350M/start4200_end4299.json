Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by $3$. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after $m$ such cuts, there will be $m+1$ parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $3$.\nFor example, if the original number is $s=3121$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $3|1|21$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $3$.\nPolycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0').

The specified number 6 forms one number that is divisible by $3$.\nIn the third example, cuts must be made between each pair of digits. As a result, Polycarp gets one digit 1 and $33$ digits 0. Each of the $33$ digits 0 forms a number that is divisible by $3$.\nIn the fourth example, an example set of optimal cuts is 2|0|1|9|201|81.

The coursework consists of $m$ pages.\nPolycarp also has $n$ cups of coffee. The coffee in the $i$-th cup Polycarp has $a_i$ caffeine in it. Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).\nSurely, courseworks are not being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least).\nLet's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots, a_{i_k}$. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write $a_{i_1}$ pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_2} - 1)$ pages, the third cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_3} - 2)$ pages,..., the $k$-th cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1)$ pages.\nIf Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.\nPolycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it). Your task is to find out this number of days or say that it is impossible.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le m \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the number of cups of coffee and the number of pages in the coursework.\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the caffeine dosage of coffee in the $i$-th cup.\n-----Output-----\nIf it is impossible to write the coursework, print -1.

It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days.\nIn the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write $4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6$ pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write $4$ pages) so the answer is $2$. It is obvious that Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework in one day in this test.\nIn the third example Polycarp can drink all cups of coffee during first day and write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 15$ pages of coursework.\nIn the fourth example Polycarp cannot drink all cups during first day and should drink one of them during the second day. So during first day he will write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) = 14$ pages of coursework and during second day he will write $5$ pages of coursework. This is enough to complete it.\nIn the fifth example Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework at all, even if he will drink one cup of coffee during each day, so the answer is -1.\n\ndef",

So friend $1$ goes to $x_1+1$, friend $2$ stays at his house $x_2$, friend $3$ goes to $x_3-1$ and friend $4$ goes to $x_4-1$. $[1, 1, 3, 3]$, $[2, 2, 3, 3]$ or $[2, 2, 4, 4]$ are also all valid options to obtain $2$ occupied houses.\nFor the maximum number of occupied houses friends can go to $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ or to $[0, 2, 4, 5]$, for example.\n\ndef",

Each kid told you which kids he/she remembered: the kid $i$ remembered kids $a_{i, 1}$ and $a_{i, 2}$. However, the order of $a_{i, 1}$ and $a_{i, 2}$ can differ from their order in the circle.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nPolycarp lives on a coordinate line at the point $x = 0$. He goes to his friend that lives at the point $x = a$. Polycarp can move only from left to right, he can pass one unit of length each second.\nNow it's raining, so some segments of his way are in the rain. Formally, it's raining on $n$ non-intersecting segments, the $i$-th segment which is in the rain is represented as $[l_i, r_i]$ ($0 \\le l_i < r_i \\le a$).\nThere are $m$ umbrellas lying on the line, the $i$-th umbrella is located at point $x_i$ ($0 \\le x_i \\le a$) and has weight $p_i$. When Polycarp begins his journey, he doesn't have any umbrellas.\nDuring his journey from $x = 0$ to $x = a$ Polycarp can pick up and throw away umbrellas. Polycarp picks up and throws down any umbrella instantly. He can carry any number of umbrellas at any moment of time. Because Polycarp doesn't want to get wet, he must carry at least one umbrella while he moves from $x$ to $x + 1$ if a segment $[x, x + 1]$ is in the rain (i.e. if there exists some $i$ such that $l_i \\le x$ and $x + 1 \\le r_i$).\nThe condition above is the only requirement. For example, it is possible to go without any umbrellas to a point where some rain segment starts, pick up an umbrella at this point and move along with an umbrella. Polycarp can swap umbrellas while he is in the rain.\nEach unit of length passed increases Polycarp's fatigue by the sum of the weights of umbrellas he carries while moving.\nCan Polycarp make his way from point $x = 0$ to point $x = a$? If yes, find the minimum total fatigue after reaching $x = a$, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers $a$, $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le a, m \\le 2000, 1 \\le n \\le \\lceil\\frac{a}{2}\\rceil$) \u2014 the point at which Polycarp's friend lives, the number of the segments in the rain and the number of umbrellas.\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($0 \\le l_i < r_i \\le a$) \u2014 the borders of the $i$-th segment under rain. It is guaranteed that there is no pair of intersecting segments. In other words, for each pair of segments $i$ and $j$ either $r_i < l_j$ or $r_j < l_i$.\nEach of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $p_i$ ($0 \\le x_i \\le a$, $1 \\le p_i \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the location and the weight of the $i$-th umbrella.\n-----Output-----\nPrint \"-1\" (without quotes) if Polycarp can't make his way from point $x = 0$ to point $x = a$. Otherwise print one integer \u2014 the minimum total fatigue after reaching $x = a$, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 2 4\n3 7\n8 10\n0 10\n3 4\n8 1\n1 2\nOutput\n14\nInput\n10 1 1\n0 9\n0 5\nOutput\n45\nInput\n10 1 1\n0 9\n1 5\nOutput\n-1\n-----Note-----\nIn the first example the only possible strategy is to take the fourth umbrella at the point $x = 1$, keep it till the point $x = 7$ (the total fatigue at $x = 7$ will be equal to $12$), throw it away, move on from $x = 7$ to $x = 8$ without an umbrella, take the third umbrella at $x = 8$ and keep it till the end (the total fatigue at $x = 10$ will be equal to $14$). \nIn the second example the only possible strategy is to take the first umbrella, move with it till the point $x = 9$, throw it away and proceed without an umbrella till the end.\n\ndef",
