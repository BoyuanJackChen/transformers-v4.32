      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Somewhere in a mountainous region of the world is a collection of $n$ villages. Connecting these villages to one another is a series of roads, always running directly between two villages and allowing travel in both directions. Due to the treacherous landscape, building these roads is expensive, so the minimum number of roads have been constructed such that each village can reach every other village via a sequence of roads. \nTrade between these villages is very important, since not every village has access to the same supply of natural resources. Many villages produce the same resource, however, so it is useful for villages to know their relative distance to other villages so that they can choose trading partners to minimize overall trading costs. Note that the distance between two villages $a$ and $b$ is the sum of the lengths of the individual roads on the shortest path that connects $a$ and $b$.\nA project has been underway to compute the distance between every pair of villages. This information has been incorporated in a table, along with a map that shows the layout of villages and roads that run between them. You have been assigned the task of distributing the table and map to all the villages for the betterment of the regional economy.\nUnfortunately, not long after you were given this task, a gust of wind blew the map right out of your hand and into the countryside. Despite your best efforts of searching for it, you have been unable to locate it. You know that you could visit all the villages to reconstruct the map and THEN start distributing the map and table, but this will take twice as long as the original task and the villages will be very displeased with you. You wonder, maybe it\u2019s possible to reconstruct the map given only the table?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input will contain the integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2500$), the number of villages in this region. The next $n$ lines will contain $n$ integers each. The $j^{\\rm th}$ integer of the $i^{\\rm th}$ line is the distance from village $i$ to village $j$. All distances are greater than zero unless $i = j$, less than $10^7$, and it is guaranteed that the distance from village $i$ to village $j$ is the same as the distance from village $j$ to village $i$.\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output $n-1$ lines with two integers $u$ and $v$ on each line, indicating that there is a road connecting villages $u$ and $v$ in this region.

Given an encrypted string (which we\u2019ll call a DRM message), the decryption process involves three steps: Divide, Rotate and Merge. This process is described in the following example with the DRM message \u201cEWPGAJRB\u201d:Divide\n\u2013 First, divide the message in half to \u201cEWPG\u201d and \u201cAJRB\u201d.Rotate\n\u2013 For each half, calculate its rotation value by summing up the values of each character ($\\textrm{A} = 0, \\textrm{B} = 1, \\ldots, \\textrm{Z} = 25$). The rotation value of \u201cEWPG\u201d is $4 + 22 + 15 + 6 = 47$. Rotate each character in \u201cEWPG\u201d $47$ positions forward (wrapping from Z to A when necessary) to obtain the new string \u201cZRKB\u201d. Following the same process on \u201cAJRB\u201d results in \u201cBKSC\u201d.Merge\n\u2013 The last step is to combine these new strings (\u201cZRKB\u201d and \u201cBKSC\u201d) by rotating each character in the first string by the value of the corresponding character in the second string. For the first position, rotating \u2018Z\u2019 by \u2018B\u2019 means moving it forward 1 character, which wraps it around to \u2018A\u2019.

But because of some of the streets being closed off, he couldn\u2019t make his delivery in time and almost lost his job. Although it is late now, he is wondering how he could have planned his delivery better, i.e., what would have been the least time needed to make his delivery while Mister George was visiting. He knows the route mister George took.\nThe city is modeled with intersections and two-way streets connecting them. For each street, Luka knows how much time he needs to traverse it (mister George needs the same amount of time).\nFor example, if Mister George starts traversing a street during minute 10 and needs 5 minutes to exit it, this street will be blocked during minutes 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

Forrest has noticed that his communications typically include repeated characters, and has designed a simple compression scheme based on repeated information. Text data is encoded for transmission, possibly resulting in a much shorter data string, and decoded after transmission to reveal the original data.\nThe compression scheme is rather simple. When encoding a text string, repeated consecutive characters are replaced by a single instance of that character and the number of occurrences of that character (the character\u2019s run length). Decoding the encoded string results in the original string by repeating each character the number of times encoded by the run length. Forrest calls this encoding scheme run-length encoding. (We don\u2019t think he was actually the first person to invent it, but we haven\u2019t mentioned that to him.)\nFor example, the string HHHeelllo is encoded as H3e2l3o1. Decoding H3e2l3o1 results in the original string. Forrest has hired you to write an implementation for his run-length encoding algorithm.\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a single line of text. The line starts with a single letter: E for encode or D for decode. This letter is followed by a single space and then a message. The message consists of $1$ to $100$ characters.\nEach string to encode contains only upper- and lowercase English letters, underscores, periods, and exclamation points. No consecutive sequence of characters exceeds $9$ repetitions.\nEach string to decode has even length. Its characters alternate between the same characters as strings to encode and a single digit between $1$ and $9$, indicating the run length for the preceding character.\n-----Output-----\nOn an input of E output the run-length encoding of the provided message.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:MyTunes, a new music application from Mapple, allows you to display and sort your music according to many different attributes. Attributes like album name, song title, artist, and song length are available, among others. One feature MyTunes does NOT have is stable sorting. You need to write the software which does this. Stable sorting would allow the user to do something like this: first sort the whole list by song title, and then sort the whole list by artist. The result is that the list of songs are sorted primarily by artist (since it\u2019s the last thing used to sort), then within each artist they are sorted by song name (since before the artist sort, the songs were ordered by song name). When sorting two songs with equal attribute values they should remain in their relative order prior to sorting (giving stable sorting).\nThe first sort starts from the order of songs as given in the input. Each subsequent sort starts from the order given by the previous sort, rather than starting from the initial order. All sorting should be done least to greatest, in lexicographic order (using ASCII values, even for numeric data).\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a list of $1$ to $20$ unique attributes, separated by single spaces. The next line contains an integer $1 \\leq m \\leq 100$ giving the number of songs that follow, one song per line. Each song has the values for all the attributes, separated by single spaces. The next line contains an integer $1 \\leq n \\leq 20$ giving the number of sorting commands. The following $n$ lines each contain one sort command, which is the name of an attribute. Initially, the song list is in the order given on the input. All attributes and values are between $1$ and $30$ characters, using only a\u2013z, A\u2013Z, $0$\u2013$9$, and underscore (_).\n-----Output-----\nAfter each sort command, print the list of attributes followed by the song list in the order given by the sort command, one song per line. Print a space between adjacent fields. Between each pair of printed lists, print a blank line.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nArtist Album Song_Title Length_seconds\n5\nTchaikovsky Piano_Favorites November 163\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work Hard_Times 192\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work London_Town 236\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work Summers_Here 163\nGeorge_Winston Summer Lullaby 215\n3\nArtist\nAlbum\nSong_Title\nSample Output:\nArtist Album Song_Title Length_seconds\nGeorge_Winston Summer Lullaby 215\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work Hard_Times 192\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work London_Town 236\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work Summers_Here 163\nTchaikovsky Piano_Favorites November 163\nArtist Album Song_Title Length_seconds\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work Hard_Times 192\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work London_Town 236\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work Summers_Here 163\nTchaikovsky Piano_Favorites November 163\nGeorge_Winston Summer Lullaby 215\nArtist Album Song_Title Length_seconds\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work Hard_Times 192\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work London_Town 236\nGeorge_Winston Summer Lullaby 215\nTchaikovsky Piano_Favorites November 163\nJames_Taylor Dad_Loves_His_Work Summers_Here 163\n\ndef",

Some participants are given the real vaccine, while others are given a placebo as the control group. The participants are tracked to determine if they are infected by three different strains (A, B, and C) of a virus. The efficacy of the vaccine against infection by a particular strain is simply the percentage reduction of the infection rate of the vaccinated group compared to the control group.\nFor example, suppose that there are $40$ people in the vaccinated group, $8$ of which are infected by strain B. Then the infection rate is $20$%. Further suppose that $50$ people are in the control group, and $30$ people are infected by strain B. Then the infection rate for the control group is $60$%. Thus the vaccine efficacy against infection is approximately $66.67$% (since $20$% is a $66.67$% percentage reduction of $60$%). If the infection rate for a particular strain in the vaccinated group is not lower than that of the control group, the vaccine is not effective against infection by that strain.\nWhat is the vaccine efficacy against infection by the three strains?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 10000$) containing the number of participants in the clinical trial.\nThe next $N$ lines describe the participants.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Our new contest submission system keeps a chronological log of all submissions made by each team during the contest. With each entry, it records the number of minutes into the competition at which the submission was received, the letter that identifies the relevant contest problem, and the result of testing the submission (designated for the sake of this problem simply as right or wrong). As an example, the following is a hypothetical log for a particular team:\n3 E right\n10 A wrong\n30 C wrong\n50 B wrong\n100 A wrong\n200 A right\n250 C wrong\n300 D right\nThe rank of a team relative to others is determined by a primary and secondary scoring measure calculated from the submission data. The primary measure is the number of problems that were solved. The secondary measure is based on a combination of time and penalties. Specifically, a team\u2019s time score is equal to the sum of those submission times that resulted in right answers, plus a 20-minute penalty for each wrong submission of a problem that is ultimately solved. If no problems are solved, the time measure is\u00a0$0$.\nIn the above example, we see that this team successfully completed three problems: E on their first attempt ($3$\u00a0minutes into the contest); A on their third attempt at that problem ($200$\u00a0minutes into the contest); and D on their first attempt at that problem ($300$\u00a0minutes into the contest). This team\u2019s time score (including penalties) is $543$. This is computed to include $3$\u00a0minutes for solving E, $200$\u00a0minutes for solving A with an additional $40$\u00a0penalty minutes for two earlier mistakes on that problem, and finally $300$\u00a0minutes for solving D. Note that the team also attempted problems B and C, but were never successful in solving those problems, and thus received no penalties for those attempts.\nAccording to contest rules, after a team solves a particular problem, any further submissions of the same problem are ignored (and thus omitted from the log). Because times are discretized to whole minutes, there may be more than one submission showing the same number of minutes. In particular there could be more than one submission of the same problem in the same minute, but they are chronological, so only the last entry could possibly be correct. As a second example, consider the following submission log:\n7 H right\n15 B wrong\n30 E wrong\n35 E right\n80 B wrong\n80 B right\n100 D wrong\n100 C wrong\n300 C right\n300 D wrong\nThis team solved 4 problems, and their total time score (including penalties) is $502$, with $7$\u00a0minutes for H, $35+20$ for E, $80+40$ for B, and $300+20$ for C.\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains $n$ lines for $0 \\leq n \\leq 100$, with each line describing a particular log entry. A log entry has three parts: an integer $m$, with $1 \\leq m \\leq 300$, designating the number of minutes at which a submission was received, an uppercase letter designating the problem, and either the word right or wrong. The integers will be in nondecreasing order and may contain repeats. After all the log entries is a line containing just the number $-1$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput two integers on a single line: the number of problems solved and the total time measure (including penalties).\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 E right\n10 A wrong\n30 C wrong\n50 B wrong\n100 A wrong\n200 A right\n250 C wrong\n300 D right\n-1\nSample Output:\n3 543\n\ndef",

Each literal refer either positively or negatively to a variable, which can be assigned a value of either True or False. The question is whether there exists an assignment to the variables such that every clause evaluates to True. No clause will contain duplicates of a literal (however it is possible that a clause contain both $\\neg x_ i$ and $x_ i$). An example of a 3-SAT instance is shown below (from sample input 1):\\[ (\\neg x_1 \\vee x_2 \\vee x_3) \\wedge (\\neg x_1 \\vee \\neg x_2 \\vee x_3) \\wedge (x_1 \\vee \\neg x_2 \\vee x_3) \\wedge (x_1 \\vee \\neg x_2 \\vee \\neg x_3) \\wedge (x_1 \\vee x_2 \\vee \\neg x_3) \\]\u00d8yvind is a judge in the competition, responsible for verifying the quality of problem instances crafted by the other judges before the contest starts. \u00d8yvind hates 3-SAT instances with less than eight clauses \u2013 as these are always satisfiable they provide no real challenge for the contestants.

Given an instance of 3-SAT, can you help find \u00d8yvind\u2019s judgement? \n-----Input-----\nThe input is a single instance of the 3-SAT problem. The first line is two space-separated integers: $m$ ($1 \\leq m \\leq 20$), the number of clauses and $n$ ($3 \\leq n \\leq 20$), the number of variables.

When the roll runs out, Nick always goes to the store and buys a new one of length $\\ell $ directly afterwards. However, sometimes the roll runs out even though Nick still needs a non-zero amount of paper. Let us call such an event a crisis. \nNick has a clever way of preventing crises from happening: he uses a backup roll. The backup roll is another roll of length $\\ell $ that is hidden somewhere in the bathroom, and when the regular roll runs out even though Nick still needs more paper, he will take that amount from the backup roll. Then he will replace the regular roll directly after the visit.\nAs you can imagine, this makes crises much less frequent. But still, the backup roll will also slowly run out, and eventually a crisis might still happen. So to generalize this, Nick wants to use several layers of backup rolls. First he will take paper from roll number $1$ (the regular roll), if it runs out he will take from roll number $2$, then if roll $2$ runs out from roll number $3$, and so on all the way up to roll number $k$.

A sentence is correctly translated when each word of the sentence is correctly translated.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line with an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 20$), the number of words in the Dutch sentence.\n - One line with $n$ words, the Dutch sentence $s$.\n - One line with an integer $m$ ($1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$), the number of words in the dictionary.\n - $m$ lines, each with three strings $d$, $e$ and $c$, a Dutch word, the English translation, and \u201ccorrect\u201d if this is the correct translation or \u201cincorrect\u201d otherwise.\nA word consists of between $1$ and $20$ lowercase letters. Each word in $s$ appears at least once as a Dutch word in the dictionary, no word appears more than $8$ times as a Dutch word in the dictionary, and each combination of a Dutch and English word appears at most once.\n-----Output-----\nIn case there is only a single translation of $s$, output one line with the translation followed by one line with \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect\u201d. In case there is more than one translation, output one line with the number of possible correct translations followed by \u201ccorrect\u201d, and one line with the number of possible incorrect translations followed by \u201cincorrect\u201d.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n7\nals mollen mollen mollen mollen mollen mollen\n4\nals when correct\nmollen moles correct\nmollen destroy correct\nmollen mills incorrect\nSample Output:\n64 correct\n665 incorrect\n\ndef",

Cookie cutters are modeled as simple polygons. (Simple polygons do not self-intersect.) The first line of input contains a number $N$ ($3 \\le N \\le 50$) denoting the number of corners of the polygon.

But new challenges lie ahead: cutting Swiss cheese. \nSwiss cheese such as Emmentaler has holes in it, and the holes may have different sizes. A slice with holes contains less cheese and has a lower weight than a slice without holes. So here is the challenge: cut a cheese with holes in it into slices of equal weight.\nBy smart sonar techniques (the same techniques used to scan unborn babies and oil fields), it is possible to locate the holes in the cheese up to micrometer precision.

For example, Han Solo might speak in Galactic Basic and Chewbacca might respond in Shyriiwook; since they each understand the language spoken by the other, they can communicate just fine like this.\nWe\u2019ll say two characters can converse if they can exchange messages in both directions. Even if they didn\u2019t understand each other\u2019s languages, two characters can still converse as long as there is a sequence of characters who could translate for them through a sequence of intermediate languages. For example, Jabba the Hutt and R2D2 might be able to converse with some help. Maybe when Jabba spoke in Huttese, Boba Fett could translate to Basic, which R2D2 understands. When R2D2 replies in Binary, maybe Luke could translate to Basic and then Bib Fortuna could translate back to Huttese for Jabba.\nIn Star Wars Episode IV, there\u2019s a scene with a lot of different characters in a cantina, all speaking different languages.

The cantina is a business, so you\u2019d like to ask as few as possible to leave.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nThe Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher.\nThe Playfair cipher uses a $5$ by $5$ table containing each letter in the English alphabet exactly once (except \u2018Q\u2019 which is missing). The table constitutes the encryption key. To more easily remember the table, it is typically generated from a key phrase. First fill in the spaces in an empty table with the letters of the key phrase (dropping spaces and duplicate letters), then fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order. The key phrase is written in the top rows of the table, from left to right. For instance, if the key phrase is \u201cplayfair example\u201d, the encryption key becomes\nP\nL\nA\nY\nF\nI\nR\nE\nX\nM\nB\nC\nD\nG\nH\nJ\nK\nN\nO\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nZ\nTo encrypt a message, one would remove all spaces and then break the message into digraphs (groups of $2$ letters) such that, for example, \u201cHello World\u201d becomes \u201cHE LL OW OR LD\u201d. Then map them out on the key table, and apply the rule below that matches the letter combination:\n - If both letters are the same (or only one letter is left), add an \u2018X\u2019 after the first letter. Encrypt the new pair and continue (note that this changes all the remaining digraphs).\n - If the letters appear on the same row of your table, replace them with the letters to their immediate right respectively (wrapping around to the left side of the row if a letter in the original pair was on the right side of the row). With the table above, the digraph \u2018CH\u2019 would be encrypted \u2018DB\u2019.\n - If the letters appear on the same column of your table, replace them with the letters immediately below respectively (wrapping around to the top side of the column if a letter in the original pair was on the bottom side of the column). With the table above, the digraph \u2018VA\u2019 would be encrypted \u2018AE\u2019.\n - If the letters are not on the same row or column, replace them with the letters on the same row respectively but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair. The order is important \u2013 the first letter of the encrypted pair is the one that lies on the same row as the first letter of the plaintext pair. With the table above, the digraph \u2018KM\u2019 would be encrypted \u2018SR\u2019.\nWrite a program that reads a key phrase and a plaintext to encrypt, and outputs the encrypted text.\nThe text to encrypt will not contain two \u2019x\u2019s following each other, or an \u2019x\u2019 as the last character, as this might cause the first rule above to repeat itself indefinitely.\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains two lines. The first line contains the key phrase. The second line contains the text to encrypt. Each line contains between $1$ and $1000$ characters, inclusive. Each character is a lower case English letter, \u2018a\u2019-\u2018z\u2019 (except \u2018q\u2019), or a space character. Neither line starts or ends with a space.\n-----Output-----\nThe output should be a single line containing the encrypted text, in upper case.
