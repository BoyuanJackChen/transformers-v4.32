These apples are numbered from 1 (left most one) to N (right most one). The types of apples are also numbered by positive integers, and the type of apple i is Ti.\nChef has recently brought two trained dogs. Both of the dogs are too intelligent to know the smell of each type of apple. If Chef gives a dog an integer x, and releases it at one end of the row of apples, then the dog smells each apple one by one. Once the dog find an apple of type x, the dog picks the apple and back to Chef's room immidiately. If there is no apple of type x, then the dog will back without any apples.\nNow Chef wants to eat two apples as soon as possible. Here the apples must have distinct types, and the sum of the types must be equal to K. Chef can release the dogs from either of the ends, namely, he can leave (both at left end) or (both at right end) or (one at left end and one at right end) and he can release them at the same time. The dogs take one second to smell each apple. However the dogs can run rapidly, so the time for moving can be ignored. What is the minimum time (in seconds) to get the desired apples from his dogs?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers N and K, denoting the number of apples and the required sum respectively.

Thus Chef needs to wait 2 seconds. In any other way, Chef can't get the desired apples in less than 2 seconds.\nIn the second example, Chef cannot get two apples such that the sum of their types is 5 so the answer is \"-1\".\n\ndef",

This murder is being investigated by none other than the Riverdale's Finest- Jughead Jones & Betty Cooper. This murder has been done exactly in the same manner as all the murders happening since the return of the deadly game Gargoyle &Griffins. Betty has decided to put an end to these murders, so they decide to interrogate each and every person in the neighbourhood.\nAs they don't know these people personally they want to first get to know about their character i.e whether a particular person is a Truth\u2212speaking\u2212person$Truth-speaking-person$ or a False\u2212speaking\u2212person$False-speaking-person$. Jughead devises a strategy of interrogating the civilians.\nJughead decides that they will collect statements from all the people in the neighbourhood about every other person living in the neighbourhood. Each person speaks a statement in form of an array consisting of T$T$ and F$ F$, which tells us what he thinks about the ith$ith$ person. Let there be N$N$ people living in the neighbourhood. So if a person i$i$ is giving his/her statement, he/her will always call himself/herself a True person i.e Statement[i]=T$Statement[i]=T$.\nSo Jughead says that they will select the maximum$maximum$ number$number$ of people that maybe speaking the truth such that their statements don't contradict and then interrogate them further about the murder.\nHelp them pick the max no. of Truth speaking people.\nNote$Note$- A person speaking falsely$falsely$ doesn't mean that the complement of his statement would be the truth$truth$. If a person is declared false$false$(i.e not included in the set) after Betty and Jughead pick their set of truth speaking people with non-contradicting statements, the person declared false might not be speaking falsely$falsely$ about anyone(except saying he himself is a true$true$ speaking person which contradicts with the selected statements) but since the selected Set of statements feels him to be a false$false$ speaking person he won't be included in the set. \nBut if a person is tagged as truth$truth$ speaking person then their Statement must be entirely correct and should not contradict with the chosen set of truth$truth$ speaking people.

All players have a rank determining their playing strength which gets updated after every game played. There are $25$ regular ranks, and an extra rank, \u201cLegend\u201d, above that. The ranks are numbered in decreasing order, $25$ being the lowest rank, $1$ the second highest rank, and Legend the highest rank. \nEach rank has a certain number of \u201cstars\u201d that one needs to gain before advancing to the next rank. If a player wins a game, she gains a star. If before the game the player was on rank $6$-$25$, and this was the third or more consecutive win, she gains an additional bonus star for that win. When she has all the stars for her rank (see list below) and gains another star, she will instead gain one rank and have one star on the new rank.\nFor instance, if before a winning game the player had all the stars on her current rank, she will after the game have gained one rank and have $1$ or $2$ stars (depending on whether she got a bonus star) on the new rank. If on the other hand she had all stars except one on a rank, and won a game that also gave her a bonus star, she would gain one rank and have $1$ star on the new rank.\nIf a player on rank $1$-$20$ loses a game, she loses a star. If a player has zero stars on a rank and loses a star, she will lose a rank and have all stars minus one on the rank below. However, one can never drop below rank $20$ (losing a game at rank $20$ with no stars will have no effect).\nIf a player reaches the Legend rank, she will stay legend no matter how many losses she incurs afterwards.\nThe number of stars on each rank are as follows:\n - Rank $25$-$21$: $2$ stars\n - Rank $20$-$16$: $3$ stars\n - Rank $15$-$11$: $4$ stars\n - Rank $10$-$1$: $5$ stars\nA player starts at rank $25$ with no stars.

She is an inspiration to Ana, who wants to make ceiling hanging sculptures with straight knitting needles and balls of wool. For safety reasons, there will be a ball at each end of each needle. Knitting needles vary in colour, length and thickness (to allow intersections of needles).\nSculptures are to be exhibited in room corners, which provide a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, with many lamps on the ceiling. Sculpture designs are made with the coordinates of the centres of the balls of wool in which knitting needles are stuck. That is, each needle $N$ is represented by a set of two different triples: $N=\\{ (x,y,z),(x\u2019,y\u2019,z\u2019)\\} $.\nAna dislikes closed chains. A true closed chain is a sequence of $k$ distinct needles, $N_1, N_2, \\ldots, N_ k$ (for some $k\\geq 3$), such that:\n - $N_1 = \\{ (x_1,y_1,z_1), (x_2,y_2,z_2)\\}, \\; N_2 = \\{ (x_2,y_2,z_2), (x_3,y_3,z_3)\\}, \\; \\ldots, \\\\ N_ k = \\{ (x_ k,y_ k,z_ k), (x_{k+1},y_{k+1},z_{k+1})\\}, \\; \\mbox{ and } \\; (x_{k+1},y_{k+1},z_{k+1})=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$\nBut her dislike of closed chains is so extreme that the shadow of the sculpture on the floor has to be free of \u201cfloor closed chains\u201d.

Monica will be moved to the temporary location at $x = M$ and Lydia to $x = L$.

You, chairman of the Backpacker\u2019s Association for Packing Carry-ons, are faced with exactly this problem. You are going on a lovely holiday with one of your friends, but now most of your time is spent in frustration while trying to pack your backpack. In order to optimize this process, you and your friend have independently set upon trying to find better ways to pack.\nAfter some time you have a serious breakthrough! Somehow you managed to solve the Knapsack problem in polynomial time, defying expectations everywhere. You are not interested in any theoretical applications, so you immediately return to your friend\u2019s apartment in order to now quickly pack your backpack optimally.\nWhen you arrive there, you find that your friend has set upon her own solution, namely to enumerate all possible packings. This means that all items you possibly wanted to bring are scattered across the entire apartment, and it would take a really long time to get all the items back together.\nLuckily you can use the work your friend has done. For every possible subset of items that you can possibly bring, she has written down the total weight of these items. Alas, she did not write down what items were part of this total, so you do not know what items contributed to each total weight. If the original weights of the items formed a collection $(a_1,\\dotsc,a_ n)$ of non-negative integers, then your friend has written down the multiset\\[ S\\big ((a_1,\\dotsc,a_ n)\\big ) := \\left\\{ \\sum _{i \\in I} a_ i \\; \\middle |\\; I \\subseteq \\{ 1, \\dots, n\\} \\right\\}. \\]\nFor example, if your friend had two items, and the weights of those two items are $2, 3$, then your friend has written down\n - $0$, corresponding to the empty set $\\{ \\} $;\n - $2$, corresponding to the subset $\\{ 2\\} $;\n - $3$, corresponding to the subset $\\{ 3\\} $;\n - $5$, corresponding to the subset $\\{ 2, 3\\} $.\nYou want to reconstruct the weights of all the individual items so you can start using your Knapsack algorithm.

In this game, the deck consists of $n$ cards where every card has one unique integer written on one side of it. The deck is shuffled randomly before the game is played. During each turn of the game, Jacob can choose to either take a card off the top of the deck and read that value, or not take a card off the deck and end the game. His final score for the game is the value of the last card taken from the deck. The deck will always have at least one card, and the first turn of the game must always be to draw the top card of the deck.\nJacob has a basic understanding of optimal stopping theory, so he devises a plan to play the game somewhat effectively. His plan is to keep drawing cards for a predetermined number ($c$) of times, then to keep going until he sees a card that is larger than all the cards he previously saw, then to stop. His score will be the value written on that card. If he never sees a larger value on a card than the first cards he skipped, he would continue drawing until the deck runs out and would be left with a score equal to the number on the last card in the deck.\nWhat is Jacob\u2019s expected score under this strategy?\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case.

The objects are droplets that are modeled in two dimensions as circles of various sizes, each moving at a constant velocity. When two circles touch they combine (i.e., agglomerate) into a single circular droplet with an area equal to the sum of the areas of the two combining droplets. The newly formed droplet\u2019s position is the area-weighted average position of the two droplets at the time of contact and its velocity is the area-weighted average velocity of the two circles. (See the following example.)The figure to the right illustrates the process of agglomeration. In the top panel of that figure, we see the leftmost droplet with radius $4$ centered at position $(-14,0)$ and with velocity $(1,0)$ moving toward a stationary droplet of radius\u00a0$3$ centered at the origin. The two droplets make contact at time $t=7.0$ as shown in the middle panel of the figure. \nThe droplet with radius\u00a0$4$ is centered at $(-7,0)$ at the time that the two droplets agglomerate into a single new droplet. The two original droplets have areas $16\\pi $ and\u00a0$9\\pi $, respectively, and thus the new droplet has area\u00a0$25\\pi $ and thus radius\u00a0$5$. The $x$-coordinate of the aggolomerated droplet is equal to $\\frac{16}{25} \\cdot (-7.0) + \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot 0.0 = -4.48$. The $y$-coordinate is $\\frac{16}{25} \\cdot 0.0 + \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot 0.0 = 0.0$. By similar calculations, the velocity of the aggolomeration is $(0.64, 0)$.\nGiven an initial configuration of droplets, your goal is to simulate their motion until reaching the final time at which an agglomeration occurs (if any). All test sets have been crafted to assure that:\n - The original droplets do not touch each other.\n - When a new droplet is formed from an agglomeration, the new droplet will not immediately be touching any other droplets. (In fact, it will be at least $0.001$ away from any other droplets.)\n - No two droplets will ever pass each other with only a single point of intersection. (In fact, changing the radius of any drop by $\\pm 0.001$ will not effect whether it collides with another.)\n - No two pairs of droplets will ever collide at precisely the same time.

Clicking any icon has a unique effect on the other icons, based on which icon is clicked and that icon\u2019s position in the sequence. Most of the icons rotate the type of other icons. A rotation changes an A to a B, B to C, C to D, D to E, E to F, and F back to A.\nHere\u2019s what the icons do when you click on one, based on the type of the icon and its position $x$ in the sequence ($1\\leq x \\leq 8$):\nType\nEffect\nA\nRotates the icons immediately to the left and right (at positions $x-1$ and $x+1$), ignoring any icon that doesn\u2019t exist (when $x=1$ or $8$).\nB\nIf the icon is at either end of the sequence, does nothing. Otherwise, changes the icon at position $x+1$ to the same type as the current icon at $x-1$.\nC\nRotates the icon at position $9-x$.\nD\nRotates all icons between position $x$ and the closest of the sequence\u2019s two ends. (Does nothing if $x$ is one of the two ends, and does not change the icon at position $x$ itself). For example, if $x=3$, the icons at $x=1$ and $2$ would be rotated. If $x=5$, then the icons at positions $6$, $7$, and $8$ would be rotated.\nE\nIf the icon is at either end of the sequence, does nothing. Otherwise, let $y$ be the number of icons between position $x$ and the closest of the sequence\u2019s two ends. Rotates the two icons at positions $x-y$ and $x+y$. For example, if $x=3$, the icons at $x=1$ and $5$ would be rotated. If $x=5$, the icons at positions $8$ and $2$ would be rotated.\nF\nIf $x$ is odd, rotates the icon at position $(x+9)/2$.

At your first day on the job you help a customer from Nijmegia, a small insignificant country famous for its enormous coins with values equal to powers of $10$, that is, $1, 10, 100, 1000$, etc. This customer wants to make a rather large payment, and you are not looking forward to the prospect of carrying all those coins to and from the vault.\nYou therefore decide to think things over first. You have an enormous supply of Nijmegian coins in reserve, as does the customer (most citizens from Nijmegia are extremely strong). You now want to minimize the total number of coins that are exchanged, in either direction, to make the exact payment the customer has to make.\nFor example, if the customer wants to pay $83$ coins there are many ways to make the exchange. Here are three possibilities:Option 1.\nThe customer pays $8$ coins of value $10$, and $3$ coins of value $1$. This requires exchanging $8 + 3 = 11$ coins.Option 2.\nThe customer pays a coin of value $100$, and you return a coin of value $10$, and $7$ coins of value $1$. This requires exchanging $1 + 1 + 7 = 9$ coins.Option 3.\nThe customer pays a coin of value $100$, and $3$ coins of value $1$. You return $2$ coins of value $10$.

The player may also stay put. There is one creeper on the map. The player and the creeper take turns simultaneously, subject to the following simple AI:\n - The creeper will only try to move towards the player, either horizontally or vertically, in a way that reduces the horizontal or vertical distance.\n - If an obstacle prevents the creeper from moving vertically, it will try to move horizontally, and vice versa.\n - If it can\u2019t move in either direction, it will stay put.\n - If the creeper can move both horizontally and vertically, it will choose the direction in which it is farther away from the player. In the case of a tie, it will move vertically towards the player.\nAfter each such turn, the game checks if the creeper is too close to the player, in which case the creeper will explode and kill the player, even if the player has already reached the exit in that move.

A binary decision diagram (BDD) over these variables is a diagrammatic representation of a boolean function $f(x_0, \\ldots, x_{n-1})$ as inputs.\nA BDD is a rooted binary tree such that all internal vertices $v$ have precisely two children. The edges connecting an internal vertex $v$ with its children are labelled with a $0$ or $1$ (exactly one of each). Each leaf vertex is also labelled with a $0$ or $1$. We note that a BDD may consist of a single vertex, which is considered to be both the root and a leaf vertex.\nGiven input $(x_0, \\ldots, x_{n-1})$, the boolean function represented by the BDD is evaluated as follows.\n - let $v$ be the root vertex\n - let $i \\leftarrow 0$\n - while $v$ is not a leaf do\n - replace $v$ with the child vertex of $v$ by traversing the edge labelled $x_ i$\n - increase $i$ by $1$\n - output the label of leaf vertex $v$\nConsider the function $f(x_0,x_1,x_2)$ represented by the BDD above.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:The color of a cat is primarily decided by three genes, coding for Black (Eumelanin), Red (Phaeomelanin) and Dilution (Melanophilin). The cat genetics experts among the readers will note that we are ignoring a wide range of genes, e.g., Tyrosinase and the white masking gene \u2013 we apologize in advance for the oversimplifications that are to ensue. \nBlack is usually written as B, Red as O, Dilution as D. In general, a cat has two copies of each gene, one from each parent (except for the red gene which is sex-bound, we\u2019ll return to that later). Each copy can be either dominant, which we\u2019ll denote using an upper case letter, or recessive, which we\u2019ll denote using a lower case letter. Thus for each gene there are three possibilities: either both copies of the gene are dominant, both are recessive, or one is dominant and the other is recessive. When describing a cat we\u2019ll write this as a pair of letters, with the second one possibly being a \u201c-\u201d to indicate a wildcard. For example, \u201cbb\u201d indicates that the cat has two recessive black genes, and \u201cB-\u201d indicates that the cat has a dominant black gene and that we don\u2019t care about whether the other one is dominant or recessive.\nWhen a cat has no dominant red (O) gene, its coat will be a variation of black, according to the following four combinations:\nB-D-: Black\nB-dd: Blue\nbbD-: Chocolate\nbbdd: Lilac\nNow, red (O or o) is sex bound on the X chromosone. This means a male cat, or tom, only has a single red gene, while a female has two. Red dominates black, meaning that a cat having an O gene will always have red coloring. Like black, red is also affected by the dilution gene. For male cats, we have the following two possible red colors (here, the black genes have no effect on the coat color):\nD-O: Red\nddO: Cream\nFor female cats the situation gets a bit more complicated. If the female has two O genes she will be be red, with variations depending on the dilution gene in exactly the same way as for male red cats:\nD-OO: Red\nddOO: Cream\nHowever, a female cat with the Oo combination will have a partially black, partially red, coat. These cats are known as Torties (Tortoiseshells), and named after both their coat colours, starting with the black. The four possible Tortie colorings are thus as follows:\nB-D-Oo: Black-Red Tortie\nB-ddOo: Blue-Cream Tortie\nbbD-Oo: Chocolate-Red Tortie\nbbddOo: Lilac-Cream Tortie\nWhen a pair of cats have kittens, the offspring will get a random set of genes from their parents according to the following simple process: for each gene, independently, one of the copies is selected uniformly at random from the father\u2019s two copies, and the other copy is selected uniformly at random from the mother\u2019s two copies. For the red gene, there is a $50\\% $ chance that the offspring will be female in which case it will get the father\u2019s red gene (and one of the mother\u2019s red genes at random), and a $50\\% $ chance that the offspring will be male in which case it will only get one of the mother\u2019s red genes (at random).\nWrite a program which, given the colors of two cats, computes the most likely color for their offspring. For cats having a color where some genes do not affect the color, assume that the corresponding genes are uniformly random (over the two choices dominant/recessive). For example, if a cat is red, you should assume that the possibilities \u201cDD\u201d and \u201cDd\u201d for the dilution gene are equally likely, and that the four possibilities \u201cBB\u201d, \u201cBb\u201d, \u201cbB\u201d and \u201cbb\u201d are equally likely for the black gene (but note that \u201cBb\u201d and \u201cbB\u201d are equivalent).\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two lines. The first line gives the color of the female cat, and the second line gives the color of the male cat. Each color is spelled and capitalized exactly as when it is listed above, and the color is valid (i.e., the male cat won\u2019t be a Tortie).\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of the possible color outcomes for the offspring of the two cats.

The version we\u2019ll be dealing with comes from the late 1800\u2019s and works as follows. The message to be encoded is written on an $n \\times n$ grid row-wise, top to bottom, and is overlaid with a card with a set of holes punched out of it (this is the grille).\nThe message is encrypted by writing down the letters that appear in the holes, row by row, then rotating the grille 90 degrees clockwise, writing the new letters that appear, and repeating this process two more times. Of course the holes in the grille must be chosen so that every letter in the message will eventually appear in a hole (this is actually not that hard to arrange).\nAn example is shown below, where the message \u201cSend more monkeys\u201d is encrypted as \u201cnoeesrksdmnyemoj\u201d, after adding a random letter to fill out the grid (this example corresponds to the first sample input.)\n Figure I.1 \nIf the message is larger than the $n \\times n$ grid, then the first $n^2$ letters are written in the grid and encrypted, then the next $n^2$ are encrypted, and so on, always filling the last grid with random letters if needed.

In this game, kindergarteners learn how to \u201ccode\u201d by creating programs that move a turtle from a starting field to a diamond. Robot Turtles is reportedly the most successful game funded by the Kickstarter incubator.\nIn the actual board game, an adult plays the role of the \u201cturtle master,\u201d which is the person that plays the role of a CPU to execute the program. As you can imagine, this is a pretty boring task that cries out for automation: in this problem, you are asked to write a program that automates the task of the turtle master.\nRobot Turtles is played on an $8 \\times 8$ board. There is one turtle (marked with the letter T), which always starts out at the bottom-left field, facing right. The board contains empty squares (marked as.), castles made out of rock (C), and castles made out of ice (I). The diamond is marked with a D. The turtle may move only onto empty squares and the square on which the diamond is located.\nA turtle program contains $4$ kinds of instructions, marked by a single letter.\n - F The turtle moves one field forward in the direction it is facing. If the turtle faces a castle or the border of the board, a program error occurs.\n - R The turtle turns $90$ degrees to the right (the turtle will just turn and stay on the same field).\n - L The turtle turns $90$ degrees to the left (the turtle will just turn and stay on the same field).\n - X The turtle fires a laser in the direction it is facing. If the square it is facing contains an ice castle, the ice castle will melt and the square will turn into an empty square. Otherwise, a program error occurs. The turtle will not move or change direction. It is a program error to fire the laser at empty squares, rock castles or outside the board.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of $9$ lines.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:A coin system $S$ is a finite (nonempty) set of distinct positive integers corresponding to coin values, also called denominations, in a real or imagined monetary system. For example, the coin system in common use in Canada is $\\{ 1,5,10,25,100,200\\} $, where $1$ corresponds to a $1$-cent coin and $200$ corresponds to a $200$-cent ($2$-dollar) coin. For any coin system $S$, we assume that there is an unlimited supply of coins of each denomination, and we also assume that $S$ contains $1$, since this guarantees that any positive integer can be written as a sum of (possibly repeated) values in $S$.\nCashiers all over the world face (and solve) the following problem: For a given coin system and a positive integer amount owed to a customer, what is the smallest number of coins required to dispense exactly that amount? For example, suppose a cashier in Canada owes a customer $83$ cents. One possible solution is $25+25+10+10+10+1+1+1$, i.e., $8$ coins, but this is not optimal, since the cashier could instead dispense $25+25+25+5+1+1+1$, i.e., $7$ coins (which is optimal in this case). Fortunately, the Canadian coin system has the nice property that the greedy algorithm always yields an optimal solution, as do the coin systems used in most countries. The greedy algorithm involves repeatedly choosing a coin of the largest denomination that is less than or equal to the amount still owed, until the amount owed reaches zero. A coin system for which the greedy algorithm is always optimal is called canonical.\nYour challenge is this: Given a coin system $S = \\{ c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_ n\\} $, determine whether $S$ is canonical or non-canonical. Note that if $S$ is non-canonical then there exists at least one counterexample, i.e., a positive integer $x$ such that the minimum number of coins required to dispense exactly $x$ is less than the number of coins used by the greedy algorithm. An example of a non-canonical coin system is $\\{ 1,3,4\\} $, for which $6$ is a counterexample, since the greedy algorithm yields $4+1+1$ ($3$ coins), but an optimal solution is $3+3$ ($2$ coins). A useful fact (due to Dexter Kozen and Shmuel Zaks) is that if $S$ is non-canonical, then the smallest counterexample is less than the sum of the two largest denominations.\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a single case.

There is a neighborhood on a long horizontal road, on which there are $n$ houses numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right. Every day a mail delivery robot receives a pile of letters with exactly one letter for each house. Due to mechanical restrictions, the robot cannot sort the letters. It always checks the letter on top of the pile, visits the house that should receive that letter and delivers it. The robot repeats this procedure until all the letters are delivered. As a result, each of the $n$ houses is visited by the robot exactly once during the mail delivery of a single day.\nThe mail delivery robot has a tracking device that records its delivery route. One day the device was broken, and the exact route was lost. However, the technical team managed to recover the moving directions of the robot from the broken device, which are represented as a string consisting of $n-1$ letters. The $i$-th letter of the string is \u2018L\u2019 (or \u2018R\u2019) if the $(i+1)$-th house visited by the robot is on the left (or right) of the $i$-th house visited. For example, if $n = 4$ and the robot visited the houses in the order of $2, 4, 3, 1$, its moving directions would be \u201cRLL\u201d.\nWith the moving directions, it may be possible to determine the order in which the robot visited the houses.

You want to catch the robbers before they leave the state.\nThe state of Calirado can be represented by a rectangular $n$-by-$m$ grid of characters, with the character in each grid cell denoting a terrain type. The robbers begin within the cell marked \u2018B\u2019, indicating the Bank of Denview. They will then travel across the state by moving from grid cell to grid cell in the four cardinal directions (left, right, up, down). (Note that the robbers pass only through grid edges, and not corners.) If the robbers manage to leave the state (by crossing any boundary edge of the grid) they will go into hiding, never to be seen again. You must stop this.\nTo catch the robbers, you can set up barricades. Barricades are placed inside a grid cell, and prevent the robbers from traveling into the cell (from any direction). Each grid square consists of a different type of terrain, with different cost for placing a barricade. You cannot place a barricade on the bank (\u2018B\u2019) or on any cell containing a dot (\u2018.\u2019), though the robbers can travel freely through these cells. Every other cell will contain a lowercase English letter, indicating a terrain type.\nFind the cheapest way to prevent the robbers from escaping Calirado.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $c$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 30$, $1 \\le c \\le 26$): the dimensions of the grid representing Calirado, and the number of different terrain types. Then follows $m$ lines of exactly $n$ characters each: the map of Calirado. Each character is either \u2018B\u2019, \u2018.\u2019, or one of the first $c$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Calirado is guaranteed to contain exactly one bank. After the grid, there is a line containing $c$ space-separated integers $1 \\leq c_ i \\leq 100000$, the costs of placing a barricade on a grid cell of each terrain type. $c_1$ is the cost for terrain type \u2018a\u2019, $c_2$ is the cost for \u2018b\u2019, and so forth.\n-----Output-----\nPrint one integer, the minimum total cost of the barricades that you need to place to prevent the robbers from escaping. If there is no way to prevent the robbers from escaping, print -1 instead.\nIn the first example, the minimum cost is to barricade the central three squares on each side of the bank for a total cost of $12$.\nIn the second example, since the bank is on the border, there is no way to prevent the robbers from escaping the state.\nIn the third example, we must prevent the robbers from leaving the bank to the top, bottom, and right, or else we cannot prevent them from leaving the state. To the left, however, it is cheaper to allow passage through the \u2018b\u2019 cell, and then barricade in each of the three directions from there.

The seats are divided into $r$ rows each containing $c$ seats. Every passenger $i$ is assigned to some particular seat located at row $a_ i$ and column $b_ i$. However, some passengers may be assigned to the same seat.\nOf course, passengers are usually okay with sitting somewhere else than their assigned seat, but they may still want to be somewhat close to their original seat.

More specifically, passenger $i$ accepts sitting at most $s_ i$ rows away from the row on their ticket.\nDue to budget reasons, you decided to travel on a Divided flight. As expected, all the passengers assigned to an overbooked seat started to fight with each other, moving around in complex ways and causing a long delay.

But the heat can be quite uncomfortable for computer science students who are new to Texas and are not used to the sweating it can cause.\nThese students want to minimize the amount they sweat while walking from their dormitory to class. When they enter the sunshine, they begin sweating at the rate $r_0$ gallons/hour (where $r_0 > 0$). The longer they stay in the sun, the more they sweat. They sweat at a rate proportional to the square of how long they have been continuously exposed to the sun. Put another way, if they are exposed to the sun for twice as long, they sweat four times as much. But if they find a shady spot along the way, their continuous sun exposure is broken and they stop sweating immediately. They can then sit in the shade and cool off completely before continuing on their journey to class.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:At one of the many climate protests, Skylar fell in love with a fellow environmental activist. Unfortunately, the two young lovers live on opposite sides of the planet and long distance travel is only practical by (gasp) air. Skylar had scolded friends and family for flying, heavily handing out the recent Swedish export flygskam (verbatim translation: flight shame). But alas, the things we do for love! Now they want your help to calculate the minimum amount of flygskam Skylar will accumulate on a one-way trip across the globe. \nTo calculate the best route you models the planet as a perfect sphere and assumes that all flights fly at the distance $6381$ km from the center of the earth. The amount of shame for a single point-to-point flight is calculated as the distance between the airports in km, plus a take-off and landing penalty of $100$, that is, two airports with the flight distance $1000$ km will result in $1100$ shame.\n-----Latitude and longitude-----\nThe positions of the airports are given as the latitude and longitude in (decimal) degrees. The latitude of a point $P$ on the earths surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line passing through $P$ and the center of the earth. The equator has latitude $0^\\circ $, points north of the equator has positive values and points south of the equator has negative values, the North Pole has latitude $90^\\circ $ and the South Pole latitude $-90 ^\\circ $. Half circles that run from the North to the South pole are called meridians. The zero meridian runs through Greenwich. The longitude of a point $Q$ is the angle between the zero meridian plane and the line that run through $Q$ and the center of the earth, with values from $- 180^\\circ $ to $+180^\\circ $, with positive values east of Greenwich.\n-----Input-----\nInput starts with one line with two integers $1 \\leq N \\leq 10000$, the number of airports and $1 \\leq M \\leq 100000$, the number of two-way flight routes. The second line has two strings $S$ and $T$, Skylar\u2019s start position and Skylar\u2019s target position. Then follows $N$ lines, each starts with a three letter (uppercase) airport code, followed by two real values numbers, the latitude and longitude in degrees. Then follows $M$ lines, each with two strings $a$ and $b$, the airports with a two-way flight connection.\nAll flight airports have unique names and all connections are between existing airports.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a real value with the minimum amount of flygskam Skylar will obtain on a one-way trip. If the target is unreachable and Skylar will be forever alone, output -1.

One of his duties is to stand at the luggage carousel and collect all the knapsacks that the teams are bringing. Gerald is a lazy person, so he just stands at the same position of the carousel and waits for bags to pass by so he can pick them up. \nThe baggage carousel consists of $s$ luggage slots, numbered in ascending order from $0$ to $s-1$. Since the baggage carousel is cyclic, luggage slots $s-1$ and $0$ also lie side by side. The carousel turns in such a way that if Gerald stands in front of slot $i$ at some point in time, he will stand in front of slot $(i+1) \\bmod s$ one time unit later.\nIn the beginning Gerald prepares a huge baggage cart at some position and stands there to wait for luggage. When a knapsack arrives in front of Gerald, he needs $t$ time units to take it and put it on the baggage cart. After these $t$ time units he is ready to pick up another knapsack. As long as there are remaining knapsacks on the luggage carousel, Gerald always takes the next one to arrive at his position as soon as he is ready after putting away the previous one.\nNow Gerald wonders about the effect of his choice of position on the time it will take him to finish this task. It is up to you to help Gerald calculate the minimum, maximum, and average time to pick up all knapsacks, taken over all $s$ possible slots, which can appear in front of Gerald after preparation.

The $i$-th tree\u2019s location is at $(x_ i, y_ i)$. The first $e$ of them in the list are close enough to neighboring open land around the rainforest so that transportation between all of them is easy by foot. Some treehouses may already be connected by direct straight cables through the air that can allow transport between them.\nResidents want easy transportation between all the treehouses and the open land, by some combination of walking (between those near the open land), and using one or more cables between treehouses. This may require the addition of more cables. Since the cables are expensive, they would like to add the smallest possible length of cable.\nThe height of a cable up two trees can be set so cables can criss-cross other cables, and not allow any snags or crashes. It is not safe to try to switch between two criss-crossed cables in mid-air!\n-----Input-----\nThe input will start with the three integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$), $e$ ($1 \\le e \\le n$), and $p$ ($0 \\le p \\le 1000$), where $p$ is the number of cables in place already.\nNext come $n$ lines, each with two real numbers $x$ and $y$ ($|x|, |y| \\le 10000$) giving the location of a treehouse. The $i$-th coordinate pair is for the treehouse with ID $i$. All coordinate pairs are unique. Real numbers are stated as integers or include one digit after a decimal point.\nNext come $p$ lines, each with two integers $a$, $b$, where $1 \\le a < b \\le n$, giving the two treehouse ids of an existing cable between their trees.

Their only problem is that most games are too easy for them, and they end up beating everyone who dares challenge them. Because of that, they\u2019re now mostly playing against each other. To make things interesting, they had a professor design a new game for them.\nThis new game was interesting at first. Nowadays, however, Albert often complains that it is impossible for him to win a particular round. After long discussions, they\u2019ve now decided to take this a step further, and actually figure out who\u2019d win if they both played optimally. They need you to write a computer program that does this for them.\nA state in the game consists of one or more $x\\times y\\times z$ cuboids. A (legal) move is choosing a cuboid, then a value for each of the three axes (basically choosing three planes), and then cutting the cuboid along these (thus removing a $1\\times y\\times z$, $x\\times 1\\times z$ and a $x\\times y\\times 1$, all overlapping, cuboid). In effect you\u2019ve created between $0$ and $8$ (inclusive) smaller cuboids. All three planes cut from the cuboid need to be on the cuboid (you can\u2019t cut away a hypothetical cuboid on the outside of the real one).\nAn example might be in order. You\u2019ve chosen a $3\\times 5\\times 4$ cuboid, and are about to cut it. You now need to choose the three planes. This means you need an $x$ between $1$ and $3$, a $y$ between $1$ and $5$ and a $z$ between $1$ and $4$. Say you choose $2$, $1$ and $3$, respectively. The first cut would alone cut the cuboid into two $1\\times 5\\times 4$ cuboids, the second into a single $3\\times 4\\times 4$ cuboid, while the third would alone cut the cuboid into a $3\\times 5\\times 1$ and a $3\\times 5\\times 2$ cuboid. Put together these cuts produces $4$ new smaller cuboids, of sizes $1\\times 4\\times 1$,$1\\times 4\\times 1$,$1\\times 4\\times 2$ and $1\\times 4\\times 2$. Note that cutting a cuboid with an axis of size $1$ would remove it altogether.\nThe players take turns making a move. The winner is the player that removes the last cuboid.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input is a line containing either RUBEN or ALBERT, the name of the player who starts that particular round.\n Then follows a line containing $N$, the number of cuboids that particular game starts with.\n$N$ lines follow, each describing a cuboid.

In this simple game, the players pick colored fruits from trees in an orchard and place them into a basket. To make the game more interesting, a raven tries to reach the orchard to steal the fruits. If the players are successful in moving all fruits into the basket before the raven can get to the orchard, they\u2019ll win. If the raven gets there first, the players lose!\nYour task is to determine the probability with which the players will win!\nThe game is played as follows. There are $4$ trees in the orchard, each bearing a different type of fruit: red apples, green apples, blue plums, and yellow pears. The raven tries to reach the orchard through a pathway containing one or more steps.\nAt each turn, the players roll a six-sided die. Four of the faces show a color (red, green, yellow, blue), the fifth face shows a fruit basket, and the sixth face shows a raven. All six faces can appear with equal probability.\n - Red, Green, Yellow, Blue. In these cases, a fruit with the corresponding color is placed into the basket, provided the tree corresponding to this color still has any fruits left to pick. Otherwise, the players move on to the next turn.\n - Fruit Basket. If the players roll the \u2019basket\u2019 face, they will pick a fruit from the tree that has the largest number of fruits left. If there are multiple such trees with the same number of fruits, any of the trees can be chosen.\n - Raven. If the \u2019raven\u2019 face appears on the die, then the raven moves one step closer towards the orchard.\nThe game is over if either the players have picked all fruits, or if the raven reaches the orchard, whichever happens first. If the raven reaches the orchard before the players have placed all fruits into the basket, the players lose.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case with a single line of input. The input contains five integer numbers: $R$, $G$, $B$, $Y$ and $S$. The values of $R, G, B$ and $Y$ are the number of red, green, blue, and yellow fruits initially on each tree, respectively, and $S$ denotes the number of steps on the raven\u2019s pathway. Since the game is intended for young children, there will be at most $4$ fruits of each color: $0 \\le R, G, B, Y \\le 4$. There will be at least one fruit overall: $0 < R + G + B + Y$. The raven will require at least $1$ and at most $8$ steps: $1 \\le S \\le 8$. The number of steps is equal to the number of times the raven must appear on the die for the players to lose.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the probability that the players will win as a floating point number.
