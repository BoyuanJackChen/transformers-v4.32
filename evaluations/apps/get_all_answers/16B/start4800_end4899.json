For every $i > 1$, let $g_ i$ be the leftmost integer in $A$ that is strictly larger than $g_{i-1}$. If there for a given $i$ is no such integer, we say that the GIS of the sequence is the sequence $(g_1, g_2,..., g_{i - 1})$.\nYour task is to, given a permutation $A$, compute the GIS of $A$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $1 \\le N \\le 10^6$, the number of elements of the permutation $A$.

The leftmost integer larger than $2$ is $3$, so $g_2 = 3$. The leftmost integer larger than $3$ is $5$ ($1$ is too small), so $g_3 = 5$. The leftmost integer larger than $5$ is $7$, so $g_4 = 7$.

An updated flag with $51$ stars rather than the current one with $50$ would cause a huge jump in U.S. flag sales.

We represent this star arrangement compactly by the number of stars in the first two rows: 6,5.\nA $51$-star flag that has the same property can have three rows of $9$ stars, interlaced with three rows of $8$ stars (with a compact representation of 9,8). Conversely, if a state were to leave the union, one appealing representation would be seven rows of seven stars (7,7).\nA flag pattern is visually appealing if it satisfies the following conditions:\n - Every other row has the same number of stars.\n - Adjacent rows differ by no more than one star.\n - The first row cannot have fewer stars than the second row.\nYour team sees beyond the short-term change to $51$ for the US flag.

Because there is only a single mech unit available after previous monster rampages, the EDF has decided to simulate the upcoming battle between the mech and the monster before launching an assault. The EDF noted that the monster\u2019s attack pattern can be simulated by a series of moves that it performs in succession. When denoting each of its moves with a single letter, the attack pattern can be simulated as a single string, which should be read from left to right. The monster has the following moves:\n - Rake, denoted by the letter \u2018R\u2019;\n - Bite, denoted by the letter \u2018B\u2019;\n - Laser breath, denoted by the letter \u2018L\u2019.\nIn order to defeat the monster, the mech must perform a counter move per move that the monster makes:\n - Slice, denoted by the letter \u2018S\u2019, counters the monster\u2019s rake;\n - Kick, denoted by the letter \u2018K\u2019, counters the monster\u2019s bite;\n - Shield, denoted by the letter \u2018H\u2019, counters the monster\u2019s laser breath;\nHowever, there is one catch. When the monster performs a subsequent combination of the three moves Rake, Bite and Laser breath, in any order, it becomes a very powerful attack for which the mech must perform a single counter move called Combo breaker, denoted by the letter \u2018C\u2019. A single Combo breaker absorbs the entire combination of three moves. Any following moves from the monster will have to be countered separately or as part of a new combination. A move of the monster can never be part of more than one combination.\nThrough extensive analysis of the monster\u2019s past behaviour, the EDF is now able to reliably predict the actions of the monster ahead of time.

Your task is to determine the maximal amount of flies that Marin could have killed in a single shot and mark one such shot in the picture.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains three integers $R$, $S$ and $K$ ($3 \\leq K \\leq R$, $S \\leq 100$) that denote the dimensions of Marin\u2019s picture and the length of the side of the racket.\nEach of the following $R$ lines contains $S$ characters that describe Marin\u2019s picture. The picture\u2019s pixels marked with \u2018*\u2019 denote the position of a fly, whereas all the other pixels are marked with \u2018.\u2019 and denote empty space. On his window, there is at least one fly that Marin can kill with his racket.\n-----Output-----\nThe first line of output must contain the maximal number of flies Marin can kill in a single shot.\nThe folllowing $R$ lines must contain Marin\u2019s picture, on it clearly marked a position of the racket that will ensure Marin kills as many flies as possible. The horizontal sides of the racket are denoted with a series of characters \u2018-\u2019 and the vertical ones with \u2018|\u2019, whereas angles are denoted with \u2018+\u2019. For a more detailed explanation, consult the sample tests.\nPlease note: Marin\u2019s racket will affect only the flies located strictly inside the racket, and the racket must be located inside the window with all its parts. In other words, it is assumed that the flies located at the sides of the racket will have enough time to fly away.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 5 3\n.....\n.*.*.\n.....\nSample Output 1:\n1\n+-+..\n|*|*.\n+-+..\nSample Input 2:\n7 6 4\n......\n.*.*.*\n......\n.*.*..\n..*...\n..*...\n*....*\nSample Output 2:\n2\n......\n.*.*.*\n+--+..\n|*.|..\n|.*|..\n+--+..\n*....*\n\ndef",

Unfortunately, he soon learned that many of his programs that he wrote for his old processor didn\u2019t work on the new processor.\nDeep inside the technical documentation for both processors, he found an explanation. In order to work faster, the new processor imposes certain constraints on the machine code of programs, constraints that never existed on the previous model.\nThe machine code of a processor consists of instructions that are executed sequentially. Each instruction uses a byte of memory. Also, instructions can have zero or more parameters, each of which uses an additional byte of memory. In machine code, parameters immediately follow an instruction.\nWhen formatted as text, machine code instructions are uppercase letters, while parameters are lowercase letters. For example:\nA\nb\nc\nb\nB\nc\nc\nC\nD\ne\nf\ng\nh\nThis program consists of four instructions; the first takes three parameters, the second two, the third none and the fourth takes four parameters. The program uses $13$ bytes of memory.\nThe new processor model fetches memory in four-byte chunks so each instruction must start at a memory address that is divisible by four (the first byte in memory is address $0$). To achieve that, we can insert NOP (no operation) instructions into the old program, instructions that do nothing and are not limited to memory locations divisible by four.

These techniques were implemented in Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine.\nThe algorithm: If we compute the difference between consecutive values in a numeric sequence, we will obtain a new sequence which is related to the derivative of the function implied by the original sequence. For sequences generated from first-order polynomials (linear functions) the successive differences will be a list of identical values, (i.e., a constant difference). For second-order polynomial functions the lists of differences will be a new sequence whose values change linearly. In turn, the list of differences of the values in this generated list (i.e., the finite differences of the list of differences) will be constant, and so on for higher-order polynomials. In general the $n^{\\text {th}}$ row of differences will be constant for an $n^{\\text {th}}$ degree polynomial.\nFor example, the first-order polynomial $3x + 3$ produces the sequence below at $x=0,1,2,3,4$, and the first differences are shown on the following line.\n3     6     9    12    15   3     3     3     3\nAs another example, the polynomial $x^2$, if evaluated at inputs $x=3, 5, 7, 9,$ produces the sequence below.\n9    25    49    81\n  16    24    32 8     8\nFurthermore, if we consider a minimum-order polynomial that produces the original sequence, its value at the next regularly spaced input can be predicted by extending the difference table.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a value $n$, designating the number of polynomial evaluations given with $2 \\leq n \\leq 10$, follwed by $n$ values $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{n}$ which represent the value of a polynomial when evaluated at $n$ regularly spaced input values. Each $v_ j$ will satisfy $-2000000 \\leq v_ j \\leq 2000000$ and at least two of those values will differ from each other.\n-----Output-----\nOutput two integer values $d$ and $v_{n+1}$, separated by a space.

In particular, for expressions consisting of alternating integers and plus symbols, every time the same program is executed, the meaning of each plus symbol is randomly chosen to be either addition or string concatenation. It follows that a single expression of this form can potentially evaluate to many different integers. For example, consider\\[ 1+9+8+4 \\]\nFor clarity, we\u2019ll use $\\boxplus $ to denote a plus symbol that the DPG runtime environment decides to interpret as string concatenation, which, it is important to note, has higher precedence than addition in DPG. Then $1+9+8+4$ can evaluate to $7$ distinct values:\\begin{align*} 1\\boxplus 9 \\boxplus 8 \\boxplus 4 & =1984\\\\ 1 \\boxplus 9 \\boxplus 8 + 4 & =198 + 4 =202\\\\ 1 \\boxplus 9 + 8 \\boxplus 4 & =19 + 84 =103\\\\ 1 \\boxplus 9 + 8 + 4 & =19 + 8 + 4 =31\\\\ 1 + 9 \\boxplus 8 \\boxplus 4 & =1 + 984 =985\\\\ 1 + 9 \\boxplus 8 + 4 & =1 + 98 + 4 =103\\\\ 1 + 9 + 8 \\boxplus 4 & =1 + 9 + 84 =94\\\\ 1 + 9 + 8 + 4 & =22 \\end{align*}\n(Note that $103$ was formed in two different ways.)

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Graphical calculators have become popular among high school students. They allow functions to be plotted on screen with minimal efforts by the students. These calculators generally do not possess very fast processors. In this problem, you are asked to implement a method to speed up the plotting of a polynomial.\nGiven a polynomial $p(x) = a_ n x^n +... + a_1 x + a_0$ of degree $n$, we wish to plot this polynomial at the $m$ integer points $x = 0, 1, \\ldots, m-1$. A straightforward evaluation at these points requires $mn$ multiplications and $mn$ additions.\nOne way to speed up the computation is to make use of results computed previously. For example, if $p(x) = a_1 x + a_0$ and $p(i)$ has already been computed, then $p(i+1) = p(i) + a_1$. Thus, each successive value of $p(x)$ can be computed with one addition each.\nIn general, we can compute $p(i+1)$ from $p(i)$ with $n$ additions, after the appropriate initialization has been done. If we initialize the constants $C_0$, $C_1$, $\\ldots $, $C_ n$ appropriately, one can compute $p(i)$ using the following pseudocode:\n  p(0) = C_0; t_1 = C_1;... t_n = C_n;\n  for i from 1 to m-1 do p(i)    = p(i-1)  + t_1; t_1     = t_1     + t_2; t_2     = t_2     + t_3; : : t_(n-1) = t_(n-1) + t_n;\n  end\nFor example, if $p(x) = a_1 x + a_0$, we can initialize $C_0 = a_0$ and $C_1 = a_1$.\nYour task is to compute the constants $C_0, C_1, \\ldots, C_ n$ for the above pseudocode to give the correct values for $p(i)$ at $i = 0, \\ldots, m-1$.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of one case specified on a single line.

I had hopes that we could use the last frame as a promotion picture, it would look great with the autumn trees in the background. But the falcon is too high, even in this very last frame caught by the camera before it broke.\u201d\n\u201cCut out the falcon from the picture in Photoshop and just move it downwards,\u201d said the falconer. \u201cIt\u2019s a routine photo manipulation.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be unnatural,\u201d objected the director. \u201cWe cannot show the public such obviously doctored pictures.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, that would be quite natural,\u201d replied the falconer. \u201cLook, the falcon in such speed does not change its orientation so much, its shape in the picture remains virtually the same in a few consecutive frames. So if you move it down artificially it would still be a very good approximation of the natural situation which really occurred during the filming.\u201d\nAfter some hesitation, the director agreed with the proposition.\nYou are given two last frames of the camera with the silhouette of the falcon in both frames. The background in the frames is identical, only the silhouette of the falcon is at a different position in both frames. The falcon is moving at a constant speed and the time between consecutive camera frames is also constant. Your task is to reconstruct the missing next frame in which the position of the falcon silhouette is changed according to its speed and to the speed of the camera. The background in the new frame should be the same as the background in the previous two frames.\n-----Input-----\nEach test case starts with a line containing two integers $M$, $N$ ($2 \\leq M, N \\leq 1000$) and a printable ASCII character $C$ enclosed in single quotes. The values on the line are separated by spaces. Next, there are $M$ lines, one empty line, and other $M$ lines. The first $M$ lines represent the first frame, the last $M$ lines represent the second frame. Each nonempty line contains string of exactly $N$ printable ASCII characters. Each character represents one pixel of the original frame. Each frame contains a complete silhouette of the falcon. In both frames all silhouette pixels are represented by the character $C$ and all pixels which do not belong to the silhouette are represented by characters other than $C$. The pixels of the silhouettes in both frames do not overlap even partially, in other words, no coordinates of a pixel of the silhouette in the first frame are the same as the coordinates of any pixel of the silhouette in the second frame. The shapes of the silhouettes in both frames are identical. The silhouette in any frame can be shifted by some number of pixels horizontally and/or vertically so that its position exactly matches the position of the silhouette in the other frame. The silhouettes do not rotate. For various technical reasons the silhouette image might not be connected, it may comprise of more disconnected regions in the frame.\nA printable ASCII character is an element of the subset of ASCII characters starting with the exclamation mark character (\u2019!\u2019, ASCII code $33$ in decimal) and ending with the tilde character (\u2019~\u2019, ASCII code $126$ in decimal).\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a picture frame consisting of $M$ lines with $N$ characters each. The frame should represent the result of exact extrapolation of the falcon\u2019s movement based on the two input frames. If the silhouette image in the second input frame is shifted horizontally and vertically by some number of pixels relatively to the first input frame then the silhouette image in the result frame should be shifted horizontally and vertically by the same number of pixels relatively to the second frame.

It can approximate the value of an optimal TSP tour in $d$ dimensions within a factor of $1+1/c$ in running time \\[ n (\\log n)^{O((c\\sqrt {d})^{d-1})}, \\]\nwhere $n$ is the number of nodes in the tour.\nMiroslava works for a computer security company and it is time to renew a shared cryptographic key in many data centres across Europe. To do this, Miroslava is going to rent a private jet and deliver the key to employees waiting at all major European airports. She wants to be back as soon as possible.\nMiroslava\u2019s company has a computer that is able to execute $p$ billions of operations per second. Since we can approximate Europe by a two-dimensional plane, we assume that the Arora-Mitchell algorithm runs for exactly\\[ \\frac{n (\\log _2 n)^{c\\sqrt {2}}}{p \\cdot 10^9} \\]\nseconds on this computer to produce the exact $(1+1/c)$-approximation of the optimal tour.\nMiroslava noticed that $c$ is a parameter of the algorithm that can be used to her advantage, but one also needs to be very careful when choosing the right value. If she sets $c$ too low, the algorithm will finish very fast but the time she spends flying around Europe will be too long. On the other hand, setting it too high will force her to wait for an answer from the computer, while she could be flying instead.\nMiroslava used to work in a different company and from there she knows that the optimal tour of all major European airports is $s$ meters long, but she wasn\u2019t ranked high enough in the company to know the actual tour. Given the speed $v$ of the private jet in meters per second, Miroslava needs $s(1 + 1 / c) / v$ seconds to complete the tour produced by the algorithm run with parameter $c$. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that Miroslava can land, leave a copy of the private key and take off from each airport in an instant.\nHow long does it take Miroslava to first run the algorithm and then distribute all the keys, assuming that she chooses the optimal parameter $c$?\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of one line with four numbers:\n - an integer $n$ ($4 \\le n \\le 1000000$), the number of airports;\n - a real number $p$ ($0.001 \\le p \\le 5000$), the number of billions of operations the computer can execute per second;\n - a real number $s$ ($10^6 \\le s \\le 10^9$), the length of the optimal tour of all European airports in meters;\n - a real number $v$ ($50 \\le v \\le 900$), the speed of the private jet in meters per second.\nAll real numbers will have at most 10 digits after the decimal point.\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line with the shortest possible time $t$ in seconds to distribute the keys and the value of the parameter $c$ Miroslava should use to achieve time $t$.

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:\nAs the coach of your university\u2019s ICPC teams, you encourage your students to solve as many Kattis problems as possible. This has numerous benefits\u00a0\u2014 for example, it helps improve students\u2019 competitive programming skills, and it also creates a strong sense of school spirit. The main reason for the latter is that each time a student solves a problem, not only does that student\u2019s individual Kattis score increase, but so does the group score for your university. It is fun and motivating for your students (and you) to watch your university move up in the Kattis rankings.\nThe collective score for a group of $n$ Kattis users is calculated as follows: Let $s_0, s_1, \\ldots, s_{n-1}$ be the the $n$ individual scores in non-increasing order (i.e., $s_0 \\geq s_1 \\geq s_2 \\geq \\ldots \\geq s_{n-1}$). Then the group score is\\[ \\frac{1}{5} \\sum _{i=0}^{n-1} s_ i \\cdot \\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)^i \\]\nSo, for example, if $n = 3$ and the individual scores are $s_0 = 500$, $s_1 = 120$, $s_2 = 75$, then the group score is\\[ \\frac{1}{5} \\left( 500 \\cdot 1 + 120 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{4}{5}\\right) + 75 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{16}{25} \\right) \\right) = 128.8 \\]\nThanks to Kattis, being an ICPC coach seems pretty easy, but sometimes you worry that the school spirit fostered by the Kattis ranking system is not enough to retain all your students. What if one of your students transfers to another university and, as a result, changes university affiliation on Kattis? How will this affect the group score for your university?\nActually, what you really want to know is the average new group score if exactly one of your students leaves. More precisely, if your students\u2019 scores are $s_0 \\geq s_1 \\geq s_2 \\geq \\ldots \\geq s_{n-1}$, let $g_ i$ be the new group score for your university if the student with score $s_ i$ leaves (and the other $(n-1)$ students remain). What is the average value of $g_ i$ over all all $n$ students?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer, $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 50$), the number of student competitive programmers at your university (all of whom use Kattis, of course). This is followed by $n$ lines, each containing one of your students\u2019 Kattis scores. These scores are listed in non-increasing order, and each score is an integer between $1$ and $10000$, inclusive.\n-----Output-----\nOutput two lines. On the first line, print your university\u2019s current Kattis group score. On the second line, print the average of the $g_ i$ values as described above. Your output will be considered correct if each value is within $10^{-6}$ of the corresponding official value. (Note that although Kattis reports every score with exactly one digit after the decimal point, you should not round your answers.)\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n500\n120\n75\nSample Output:\n128.8\n89.06666666666666\n\ndef",

The idea was that all developers should make sure that every code change they push to the master branch of their software repository strictly follows the coding guidelines. After all, one of the developers, Perikles, has been doing this since long before these regulations became effective so how hard could it be? \nRather than investing a lot of time figuring out why this degradation in productivity occurred, the line manager suggests that they loosen their requirement: developers can push code that weakly violates the guidelines as long as they run cleanup phases on the code from time to time to make sure the repository is tidy.\nShe suggests a metric where the \u201cdirtiness\u201d of a developer\u2019s code is the sum of the pushes that violate the guidelines \u2013 so-called dirty pushes \u2013 made by that developer, each weighted by the number of days since it was pushed. The number of days since a dirty push is a step function that increases by one each midnight following the push. Hence, if a developer has made dirty pushes on days $1$, $2$, and $5$, the dirtiness on day $6$ is $5+4+1=10$. She suggests that a cleanup phase, completely fixing all violations of the coding guidelines, must be completed before the dirtiness reaches $20$. One of the developers, Petra, senses that this rule must be obeyed not only because it is a company policy. Breaking it will also result in awkward meetings with a lot of concerned managers who all want to know why she cannot be more like Perikles? Still, she wants to run the cleanup phase as seldomly as possible, and always postpones it until it is absolutely necessary. A cleanup phase is always run at the end of the day and fixes every dirty push done up to and including that day. Since all developers are shuffled to new projects at the start of each year, no dirtiness should be left after midnight at the end of new year\u2019s eve.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 365$), the number of dirty pushes made by Petra during a year. The second line contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_ n$ ($1 \\leq d_ i \\leq 365$ for each $1 \\le i \\le n$) giving the days when Petra made dirty pushes.

One of the surprisingly difficult problems turns out to be right-of-way at an intersection. The local traffic regulations prescribe that your vehicle must yield the right-of-way if one of the following two conditions is satisfied:\n - You want to pass straight through the intersection; another vehicle is approaching from your right.\n - You want to turn left at the intersection; another vehicle is approaching from the opposite direction or from your right.\nNote that it is not important in which direction the other vehicle wants to leave the intersection.\nWrite a program that decides if your car should yield the right-of-way to the other vehicle.\n-----Input-----\nThree strings $a,b,c \\in \\{ \\text {North},\\text {South},\\text {East},\\text {West}\\} $, corresponding to the direction from which you arrive, the direction in which you want to leave, and the direction from which the other vehicle approaches.

He had been using the \u201cCaesar\u201d cipher to encrypt his diary until recently, when he learned a hard lesson about its strength by catching his sister Mary browsing through the diary without any problems.\nRapidly searching for an alternative, John found a solution: the famous \u201cAutokey\u201d cipher. He uses a version that takes the $26$ lower-case letters \u2018a\u2019\u2013\u2018z\u2019 and internally translates them in alphabetical order to the numbers $0$ to $25$.\nThe encryption key $k$ begins with a secret prefix of $n$ letters.

However, very few people know that this monument contains a secret chamber. This sounds like something out of a plot of a Hollywood movie, but the chamber really exists. It can be found behind the head of Abraham Lincoln and was designed to serve as a Hall of Records to store important historical U.S.\u00a0documents and artifacts. Historians claim that the construction of the hall was halted in 1939 and the uncompleted chamber was left untouched until the late 1990s, but this is not the whole truth. \nIn 1982, the famous archaeologist S.\u00a0Dakota Jones secretly visited the monument and found that the chamber actually was completed, but it was kept confidential. This seemed suspicious and after some poking around, she found a hidden vault and some documents inside. Unfortunately, these documents did not make any sense and were all gibberish. She suspected that they had been written in a code, but she could not decipher them despite all her efforts.\nEarlier this week when she was in the area to follow the ACM-ICPC World Finals, Dr.\u00a0Jones finally discovered the key to deciphering the documents, in Connolly Hall of SDSM&T. She found a document that contains a list of translations of letters. Some letters may have more than one translation, and others may have no translation. By repeatedly applying some of these translations to individual letters in the gibberish documents, she might be able to decipher them to yield historical U.S.\u00a0documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. She needs your help.\nYou are given the possible translations of letters and a list of pairs of original and deciphered words. Your task is to verify whether the words in each pair match. Two words match if they have the same length and if each letter of the first word can be turned into the corresponding letter of the second word by using the available translations zero or more times.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 500$) and $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$), where $m$ is the number of translations of letters and $n$ is the number of word pairs. Each of the next $m$ lines contains two distinct space-separated letters $a$ and $b$, indicating that the letter $a$ can be translated to the letter $b$. Each ordered pair of letters $(a, b)$ appears at most once. Following this are $n$ lines, each containing a word pair to check. Translations and words use only lowercase letters \u2018a\u2019\u2013\u2018z\u2019, and each word contains at least $1$ and at most $50$ letters.\n-----Output-----\nFor each pair of words, display yes if the two words match, and no otherwise.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n9 5\nc t\ni r\nk p\no c\nr o\nt e\nt f\nu h\nw p\nwe we\ncan the\nwork people\nit of\nout the\nSample Output:\nyes\nno\nno\nyes\nyes\n\ndef",
