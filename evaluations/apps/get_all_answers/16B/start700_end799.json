Princess Heidi has received information about the stars in the nearby solar system from the Rebel spies and now, to help her identify the exact location of the Death Star, she needs to know whether this information is correct. \nTwo rebel spies have provided her with the maps of the solar system. Each map is an N \u00d7 N grid, where each cell is either occupied by a star or empty. To see whether the information is correct, Heidi needs to know whether the two maps are of the same solar system, or if possibly one of the spies is actually an Empire double agent, feeding her false information.\nUnfortunately, spies may have accidentally rotated a map by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, or flipped it along the vertical or the horizontal axis, before delivering it to Heidi. If Heidi can rotate or flip the maps so that two of them become identical, then those maps are of the same solar system. Otherwise, there are traitors in the Rebel ranks!

You need to transform word s into word t\". The task looked simple to the guys because they know the suffix data structures well. Bizon Senior loves suffix automaton. By applying it once to a string, he can remove from this string any single character. Bizon Middle knows suffix array well.

How can he explain to his literature teacher that he isn't going to become a writer? In fact, he is going to become a programmer. So, he would take great pleasure in writing a program, but none \u2014 in writing a composition.\nAs Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his imagination, he suddenly wondered: what is the least number of times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position to another one?\nLet's describe his question more formally: to type a text, Vasya is using the text editor. He has already written n lines, the i-th line contains a_{i} characters (including spaces). If some line contains k characters, then this line overall contains (k + 1) positions where the cursor can stand: before some character or after all characters (at the end of the line). Thus, the cursor's position is determined by a pair of integers (r, c), where r is the number of the line and c is the cursor's position in the line (the positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line).\nVasya doesn't use the mouse to move the cursor. He uses keys \"Up\", \"Down\", \"Right\" and \"Left\". When he pushes each of these keys, the cursor shifts in the needed direction. Let's assume that before the corresponding key is pressed, the cursor was located in the position (r, c), then Vasya pushed key: \"Up\": if the cursor was located in the first line (r = 1), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the previous line (with number r - 1), to the same position. At that, if the previous line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position c there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number r - 1; \"Down\": if the cursor was located in the last line (r = n), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the next line (with number r + 1), to the same position. At that, if the next line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position c there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number r + 1; \"Right\": if the cursor can move to the right in this line (c < a_{r} + 1), then it moves to the right (to position c + 1). Otherwise, it is located at the end of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the \"Right\" key; \"Left\": if the cursor can move to the left in this line (c > 1), then it moves to the left (to position c - 1). Otherwise, it is located at the beginning of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the \"Left\" key.\nYou've got the number of lines in the text file and the number of characters, written in each line of this file.

Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain n distinct integers v_1, v_2,..., v_{n} where v_1 = a and v_{n} = b. The second line should contain n distinct integers u_1, u_2,..., u_{n} where u_1 = c and u_{n} = d.\nTwo paths generate at most 2n - 2 roads: (v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3),..., (v_{n} - 1, v_{n}), (u_1, u_2), (u_2, u_3),..., (u_{n} - 1, u_{n}). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than k distinct roads or any other condition breaks. Note that (x, y) and (y, x) are the same road.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 11\n2 4 7 3\nOutput\n2 7 1 3 6 5 4\n7 1 5 4 6 2 3\nInput\n1000 999\n10 20 30 40\nOutput\n-1\n-----Note-----\nIn the first sample test, there should be 7 cities and at most 11 roads.

In the Giga Tower, if you write code at a floor with lucky floor number, good luck will always be with you (Well, this round is #278, also lucky, huh?).\nTourist Henry goes to the tower to seek good luck. Now he is at the floor numbered a. He wants to find the minimum positive integer b, such that, if he walks b floors higher, he will arrive at a floor with a lucky number. \n-----Input-----\nThe only line of input contains an integer a ( - 10^9 \u2264 a \u2264 10^9).\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum b in a line.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n179\nOutput\n1\nInput\n-1\nOutput\n9\nInput\n18\nOutput\n10\n-----Note-----\nFor the first sample, he has to arrive at the floor numbered 180.\nFor the second sample, he will arrive at 8.\nNote that b should be positive, so the answer for the third sample is 10, not 0.\n\ndef",

Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 < a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_{|a|} < M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible.

This counter can store some value as a decimal number; at first, the counter has value $0$. \nThe counter performs the following algorithm: it prints its lowest digit and, after that, adds either $x$ or $y$ to its value. So all sequences this counter generates are starting from $0$. For example, a $4$-$2$-counter can act as follows:  it prints $0$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $4$, and the output is $0$;  it prints $4$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $8$, and the output is $04$;  it prints $8$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $12$, and the output is $048$;  it prints $2$, and adds $2$ to its value, so the current value is $14$, and the output is $0482$;  it prints $4$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $18$, and the output is $04824$. \nThis is only one of the possible outputs; for example, the same counter could generate $0246802468024$ as the output, if we chose to add $2$ during each step.\nYou wrote down a printed sequence from one of such $x$-$y$-counters.

Each atom can be in an excited. Exciting atom $i$ requires $D_i$ energy. When atom $i$ is excited, it will give $A_i$ energy. You can excite any number of atoms (including zero).\nThese atoms also form a peculiar one-way bond. For each $i$, $(1 \\le i < N)$, if atom $i$ is excited, atom $E_i$ will also be excited at no cost. Initially, $E_i$ = $i+1$. Note that atom $N$ cannot form a bond to any atom.\nMr. Chanek must change exactly $K$ bonds. Exactly $K$ times, Mr. Chanek chooses an atom $i$, $(1 \\le i < N)$ and changes $E_i$ to a different value other than $i$ and the current $E_i$.

After that he measured the average height of each cell above Rybinsk sea level and obtained a matrix of heights of size $n \\times m$. The cell $(i, j)$ lies on the intersection of the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column and has height $h_{i, j}$. \nSeryozha is going to look at the result of his work in the browser.
