There are n commodities produced by the company. For each of them there is exactly one integer in the final report, that denotes corresponding revenue. Before the report gets to Blake, it passes through the hands of m managers. Each of them may reorder the elements in some order. Namely, the i-th manager either sorts first r_{i} numbers in non-descending or non-ascending order and then passes the report to the manager i + 1, or directly to Blake (if this manager has number i = m).\nEmployees of the \"Blake Technologies\" are preparing the report right now. You know the initial sequence a_{i} of length n and the description of each manager, that is value r_{i} and his favourite order.

The time to enjoy those around them is so little that some even stand in queues to several rooms at the same time in the clinic, running from one queue to another.\n(Cultural note: standing in huge and disorganized queues for hours is a native tradition in Russia, dating back to the Soviet period. Queues can resemble crowds rather than lines. Not to get lost in such a queue, a person should follow a strict survival technique: you approach the queue and ask who the last person is, somebody answers and you join the crowd. Now you're the last person in the queue till somebody else shows up. You keep an eye on the one who was last before you as he is your only chance to get to your destination) I'm sure many people have had the problem when a stranger asks who the last person in the queue is and even dares to hint that he will be the last in the queue and then bolts away to some unknown destination. These are the representatives of the modern world, in which the ratio of lack of time is so great that they do not even watch foreign top-rated TV series.

If the beaver did not know his correct position in the queue, then it might be his turn to go get an ECG, or maybe he should wait for a long, long time...\nAs you've guessed, the Smart Beaver was in a hurry home, so he gave you all the necessary information for you to help him to determine what his number in the queue can be.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3) and x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of beavers that stand in the queue and the Smart Beaver's number, correspondingly.

There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. \nIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid.

There are two types of relations: synonymy (i.\u00a0e. the two words mean the same) and antonymy (i.\u00a0e. the two words mean the opposite). From time to time he discovers a new relation between two words.\nHe know that if two words have a relation between them, then each of them has relations with the words that has relations with the other. For example, if like means love and love is the opposite of hate, then like is also the opposite of hate. One more example: if love is the opposite of hate and hate is the opposite of like, then love means like, and so on.\nSometimes Mahmoud discovers a wrong relation. A wrong relation is a relation that makes two words equal and opposite at the same time. For example if he knows that love means like and like is the opposite of hate, and then he figures out that hate means like, the last relation is absolutely wrong because it makes hate and like opposite and have the same meaning at the same time.\nAfter Mahmoud figured out many relations, he was worried that some of them were wrong so that they will make other relations also wrong, so he decided to tell every relation he figured out to his coder friend Ehab and for every relation he wanted to know is it correct or wrong, basing on the previously discovered relations. If it is wrong he ignores it, and doesn't check with following relations.\nAfter adding all relations, Mahmoud asked Ehab about relations between some words based on the information he had given to him. Ehab is busy making a Codeforces round so he asked you for help.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains three integers n, m and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m, q \u2264 10^5) where n is the number of words in the dictionary, m is the number of relations Mahmoud figured out and q is the number of questions Mahmoud asked after telling all relations.\nThe second line contains n distinct words a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} consisting of small English letters with length not exceeding 20, which are the words in the dictionary.\nThen m lines follow, each of them contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2) followed by two different words x_{i} and y_{i} which has appeared in the dictionary words. If t = 1, that means x_{i} has a synonymy relation with y_{i}, otherwise x_{i} has an antonymy relation with y_{i}.\nThen q lines follow, each of them contains two different words which has appeared in the dictionary. That are the pairs of words Mahmoud wants to know the relation between basing on the relations he had discovered.\nAll words in input contain only lowercase English letters and their lengths don't exceed 20 characters. In all relations and in all questions the two words are different.\n-----Output-----\nFirst, print m lines, one per each relation. If some relation is wrong (makes two words opposite and have the same meaning at the same time) you should print \"NO\" (without quotes) and ignore it, otherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes).\nAfter that print q lines, one per each question.

When you teach him, you are supposed to teach all the chapters of a subject continuously.\nLet us say that his initial per chapter learning power of a subject is x hours. In other words he can learn a chapter of a particular subject in x hours.\nWell Devu is not complete dumb, there is a good thing about him too. If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.\nYou can teach him the n subjects in any possible order.

Consider the order of subjects: 1, 2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 12 hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him second subject will take 2 \u00d7 1 = 2 hours. Hence you will need to spend 12 + 2 = 14 hours.\nConsider the order of subjects: 2, 1. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 hours to teach the second subject. After teaching the second subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him the first subject will take 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 hours. Hence you will need to spend 11 hours.\nSo overall, minimum of both the cases is 11 hours.\nLook at the third example. The order in this example doesn't matter. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him 2 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him 1 hours per chapter. In total it takes 6 hours.\n\ndef",

On the second stage the number is raised to the fifth power. The result of the shuffle and exponentiation of the number 12345 is 455\u00a0422\u00a0043\u00a0125\u00a0550\u00a0171\u00a0232. The answer is the 5 last digits of this result. For the number 12345 the answer should be 71232.\nVasya is going to write a keygen program implementing this algorithm.

The image is in black and white, therefore the color of each pixel will be an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive).\nTo implement the filter, students are required to divide the black and white color range [0, 255] into groups of consecutive colors, and select one color in each group to be the group\u2019s key.

The exam will last for exactly T milliseconds and will consist of n problems. You can either solve problem i in exactly t_{i} milliseconds or ignore it and spend no time. You don't need time to rest after solving a problem, either.\nUnfortunately, your teacher considers some of the problems too easy for you. Thus, he assigned an integer a_{i} to every problem i meaning that the problem i can bring you a point to the final score only in case you have solved no more than a_{i} problems overall (including problem i).\nFormally, suppose you solve problems p_1, p_2,..., p_{k} during the exam.

He starts with the whole base and in one step he can do either of following:   if the current length is at least $2$, divide the base into $2$ equal halves and destroy them separately, or  burn the current base. If it contains no avenger in it, it takes $A$ amount of power, otherwise it takes his $B \\cdot n_a \\cdot l$ amount of power, where $n_a$ is the number of avengers and $l$ is the length of the current base.
