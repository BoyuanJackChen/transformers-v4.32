Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.\nAll levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).\nPolycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.\nSo he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers \u2014 $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.\nHelp him to check the correctness of his records.\nFor your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \\le T \\le 500)$ \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \\le p_i, c_i \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $i$-th moment of time.\nNote that the stats are given in chronological order.\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case print a single line.\nIf there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print \"YES\".\nOtherwise, print \"NO\".\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n1 2\n2\n1 0\n1000 3\n4\n10 1\n15 2\n10 2\n15 2\n1\n765 432\n2\n4 4\n4 3\n5\n0 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n-----Note-----\nIn the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.\nThe second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.\nIn the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.\nThe fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.\nIn the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.\nNobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.\n\ndef",

ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.\nIn Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. \nZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\\frac{A}{B}$.

Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$.

Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\").

Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

In case that there is no such $d$, print a single integer $0$.\nRecall that $\\lceil x \\rceil$ represents the smallest integer that is not less than $x$ and that zero ($0$) is neither positive nor negative.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array.\nThe second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-10^3 \\le a_i \\le 10^3$).\n-----Output-----\nPrint one integer $d$ ($-10^3 \\leq d \\leq 10^3$ and $d \\neq 0$) that satisfies the given condition. If there are multiple values of $d$ that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such $d$, print a single integer $0$.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n10 0 -7 2 6\nOutput\n4\nInput\n7\n0 0 1 -1 0 0 2\nOutput\n0\n-----Note-----\nIn the first sample, $n = 5$, so we need at least $\\lceil\\frac{5}{2}\\rceil = 3$ positive numbers after division. If $d = 4$, the array after division is $[2.5, 0, -1.75, 0.5, 1.5]$, in which there are $3$ positive numbers (namely: $2.5$, $0.5$, and $1.5$).\nIn the second sample, there is no valid $d$, so $0$ should be printed.\n\ndef",

Besides, he wants to show that Polycarpus's mind and Paraskevi's beauty are equally matched, so the two bars must have the same number of squares.\nTo make the bars have the same number of squares, Polycarpus eats a little piece of chocolate each minute. Each minute he does the following:  he either breaks one bar exactly in half (vertically or horizontally) and eats exactly a half of the bar,  or he chips of exactly one third of a bar (vertically or horizontally) and eats exactly a third of the bar. \nIn the first case he is left with a half, of the bar and in the second case he is left with two thirds of the bar.\nBoth variants aren't always possible, and sometimes Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third. For example, if the bar is 16 \u00d7 23, then Polycarpus can chip off a half, but not a third. If the bar is 20 \u00d7 18, then Polycarpus can chip off both a half and a third. If the bar is 5 \u00d7 7, then Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third.\nWhat is the minimum number of minutes Polycarpus needs to make two bars consist of the same number of squares?

This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7k_{i} products.

The three friends then decided to go to Katie's home to celebrate Kuro's winning. After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$, $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$) \u2014 the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2},..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1$) \u2014 the colors of the pieces.\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n-1 0 1\nOutput\n6\nInput\n2 1\n1 0\nOutput\n1\nInput\n1 1\n-1\nOutput\n2\n-----Note-----\nIn the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below.

There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.\nHe decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \\leq k \\leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \\cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \\leq c \\leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).\nFor example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.\nAfter closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$).

While listening to \"The White Buttons\" and their hit song \"Dacan the Baker\", he met another robot for whom he was sure is the love of his life. Well, his summer, at least. Anyway, R3D3 was too shy to approach his potential soulmate, so he decided to write her a love letter. However, he stumbled upon a problem. Due to a terrorist threat, the Intergalactic Space Police was monitoring all letters sent in the area. Thus, R3D3 decided to invent his own alphabet, for which he was sure his love would be able to decipher.\nThere are n letters in R3D3\u2019s alphabet, and he wants to represent each letter as a sequence of '0' and '1', so that no letter\u2019s sequence is a prefix of another letter's sequence.

For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.\nIn the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator.

After starting from the point x = 0, it reaches the point x = a, immediately turns back and then moves to the point x = 0. After returning to the point x = 0 it immediately goes back to the point x = a and so on. Thus, the bus moves from x = 0 to x = a and back. Moving from the point x = 0 to x = a or from the point x = a to x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make k journeys.\nThe petrol tank of the bus can hold b liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.\nThere is a gas station in point x = f. This point is between points x = 0 and x = a. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n-----Input-----\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at.

The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image.

Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\n-----Input-----\nThe input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.\n-----Output-----\nIf the first team can win, print phrase \"Team 1\" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase \"Team 2\" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print \"Draw\" (without the quotes).\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 100\n100 1\n99 99\n99 99\nOutput\nTeam 1\nInput\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n2 2\nOutput\nTeam 2\nInput\n3 3\n2 2\n1 1\n2 2\nOutput\nDraw\n-----Note-----\nLet consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.\nConsider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).\n\ndef",

The $j$-th piece of the function is the segment $P_{j}P_{j + 1}$.\nIn one move you can increase the $y$-coordinate of any point with odd $x$-coordinate (i.e. such points are $P_1, P_3, \\dots, P_{2n-1}$) by $1$. Note that the corresponding segments also change.\nFor example, the following plot shows a function for $n=3$ (i.e. number of points is $2\\cdot3+1=7$) in which we increased the $y$-coordinate of the point $P_1$ three times and $y$-coordinate of the point $P_5$ one time: [Image] \nLet the area of the plot be the area below this plot and above the coordinate axis OX. For example, the area of the plot on the picture above is 4 (the light blue area on the picture above is the area of the plot drawn on it).\nLet the height of the plot be the maximum $y$-coordinate among all initial points in the plot (i.e. points $P_0, P_1, \\dots, P_{2n}$). The height of the plot on the picture above is 3.\nYour problem is to say which minimum possible height can have the plot consisting of $2n+1$ vertices and having an area equal to $k$. Note that it is unnecessary to minimize the number of moves.\nIt is easy to see that any answer which can be obtained by performing moves described above always exists and is an integer number not exceeding $10^{18}$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 10^{18}$) \u2014 the number of vertices in a plot of a piecewise function and the area we need to obtain.\n-----Output-----\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum possible height of a plot consisting of $2n+1$ vertices and with an area equals $k$.

Two floors are called adjacent if their numbers differ by one. Masha decided to visit Egor. Masha lives on the floor $x$, Egor on the floor $y$ (not on the same floor with Masha).\nThe house has a staircase and an elevator. If Masha uses the stairs, it takes $t_1$ seconds for her to walk between adjacent floors (in each direction). The elevator passes between adjacent floors (in each way) in $t_2$ seconds. The elevator moves with doors closed. The elevator spends $t_3$ seconds to open or close the doors. We can assume that time is not spent on any action except moving between adjacent floors and waiting for the doors to open or close. If Masha uses the elevator, it immediately goes directly to the desired floor.\nComing out of the apartment on her floor, Masha noticed that the elevator is now on the floor $z$ and has closed doors. Now she has to choose whether to use the stairs or use the elevator. \nIf the time that Masha needs to get to the Egor's floor by the stairs is strictly less than the time it will take her using the elevator, then she will use the stairs, otherwise she will choose the elevator.\nHelp Mary to understand whether to use the elevator or the stairs.\n-----Input-----\nThe only line contains six integers $x$, $y$, $z$, $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$ ($1 \\leq x, y, z, t_1, t_2, t_3 \\leq 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the floor Masha is at, the floor Masha wants to get to, the floor the elevator is located on, the time it takes Masha to pass between two floors by stairs, the time it takes the elevator to pass between two floors and the time it takes for the elevator to close or open the doors.\nIt is guaranteed that $x \\ne y$.\n-----Output-----\nIf the time it will take to use the elevator is not greater than the time it will take to use the stairs, print \u00abYES\u00bb (without quotes), otherwise print \u00abNO> (without quotes).\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 1 4 4 2 1\nOutput\nYES\nInput\n1 6 6 2 1 1\nOutput\nNO\nInput\n4 1 7 4 1 2\nOutput\nYES\n-----Note-----\nIn the first example:\nIf Masha goes by the stairs, the time she spends is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$, because she has to go $4$ times between adjacent floors and each time she spends $4$ seconds. \nIf she chooses the elevator, she will have to wait $2$ seconds while the elevator leaves the $4$-th floor and goes to the $5$-th. After that the doors will be opening for another $1$ second. Then Masha will enter the elevator, and she will have to wait for $1$ second for the doors closing. Next, the elevator will spend $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ seconds going from the $5$-th floor to the $1$-st, because the elevator has to pass $4$ times between adjacent floors and spends $2$ seconds each time. And finally, it will take another $1$ second before the doors are open and Masha can come out. \nThus, all the way by elevator will take $2 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 13$ seconds, which is less than $16$ seconds, so Masha has to choose the elevator.\nIn the second example, it is more profitable for Masha to use the stairs, because it will take $13$ seconds to use the elevator, that is more than the $10$ seconds it will takes to go by foot.\nIn the third example, the time it takes to use the elevator is equal to the time it takes to walk up by the stairs, and is equal to $12$ seconds.

By a lucky coincidence, the old rivals made it to the finals: company R1 and company R2. \nThe finals will have n questions, m of them are auction questions and n - m of them are regular questions. Each question has a price. The price of the i-th question is a_{i} points. During the game the players chose the questions.

The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute m but made w wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is $\\operatorname{max}(0.3 x,(1 - \\frac{m}{250}) x - 50 w)$. His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, where m_{i} (0 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i.

He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed.  $8$ \nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (r, c) the cell located at the row r and at the column c.\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r - 1, c), while moving down means the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r + 1, c). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.\n-----Output-----\nPrint 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory.

Unfortunately, the company that made the banner mixed up two orders and delivered somebody else's banner that contains someone else's word. The word on the banner consists only of upper-case English letters.\nThere is very little time to correct the mistake. All that we can manage to do is to cut out some substring from the banner, i.e. several consecutive letters. After that all the resulting parts of the banner will be glued into a single piece (if the beginning or the end of the original banner was cut out, only one part remains); it is not allowed change the relative order of parts of the banner (i.e. after a substring is cut, several first and last letters are left, it is allowed only to glue the last letters to the right of the first letters).

For example, sequences \"(())()\", \"()\" and \"(()(()))\" are correct, while \")(\", \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not. Each bracket in CBS has a pair. For example, in \"(()(()))\":  1st bracket is paired with 8th,  2d bracket is paired with 3d,  3d bracket is paired with 2d,  4th bracket is paired with 7th,  5th bracket is paired with 6th,  6th bracket is paired with 5th,  7th bracket is paired with 4th,  8th bracket is paired with 1st. \nPolycarp's editor currently supports only three operations during the use of CBS.

You need to find out whether it is possible to buy suits to form a palindrome, and if it's possible, what's the minimal cost of doing so.

Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor +  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor = 10 + 10 =  20.\nIn the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is $\\lfloor \\frac{20}{10} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{19}{10} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{20}{10} \\rfloor = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5$.\nIn the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to $\\lfloor \\frac{100}{10} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{100}{10} \\rfloor = 10 + 10 = 20$.\n\ndef",

As usual, about $80\\%$ of applicants are girls and majority of them are going to live in the university dormitory for the next $4$ (hopefully) years.\nThe dormitory consists of $n$ rooms and a single mouse! Girls decided to set mouse traps in some rooms to get rid of the horrible monster. Setting a trap in room number $i$ costs $c_i$ burles. Rooms are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\nMouse doesn't sit in place all the time, it constantly runs.

If the mouse is in some room with a mouse trap in it, then the mouse get caught into this trap.\nThat would have been so easy if the girls actually knew where the mouse at.

His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression. Well, or like multiple arithmetic progressions.\nPolycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}, then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions, written one after the other. For example, sequence (8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 4, 7, 10, 2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8, 6, 4, 2), (1, 4, 7, 10) and (2), which are written one after another.\nUnfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years (a census of the population doesn't occur every year, after all). For this reason, some values of a_{i} \u200b\u200bmay be unknown. Such values are represented by number -1.\nFor a given sequence a = (a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}), which consists of positive integers and values \u200b\u200b-1, find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a. To get a, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values \u200b\u200b-1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values a_{i} > 0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions.\nLet us remind you that a finite sequence c is called an arithmetic progression if the difference c_{i} + 1 - c_{i} of any two consecutive elements in it is constant.

There are $n$ parties, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th party has received $a_i$ seats in the parliament.\nAlice's party has number $1$. In order to become the prime minister, she needs to build a coalition, consisting of her party and possibly some other parties. There are two conditions she needs to fulfil:   The total number of seats of all parties in the coalition must be a strict majority of all the seats, i.e. it must have strictly more than half of the seats. For example, if the parliament has $200$ (or $201$) seats, then the majority is $101$ or more seats.  Alice's party must have at least $2$ times more seats than any other party in the coalition. For example, to invite a party with $50$ seats, Alice's party must have at least $100$ seats. \nFor example, if $n=4$ and $a=[51, 25, 99, 25]$ (note that Alice'a party has $51$ seats), then the following set $[a_1=51, a_2=25, a_4=25]$ can create a coalition since both conditions will be satisfied. However, the following sets will not create a coalition:\n  $[a_2=25, a_3=99, a_4=25]$ since Alice's party is not there;  $[a_1=51, a_2=25]$ since coalition should have a strict majority;  $[a_1=51, a_2=25, a_3=99]$ since Alice's party should have at least $2$ times more seats than any other party in the coalition. \nAlice does not have to minimise the number of parties in a coalition. If she wants, she can invite as many parties as she wants (as long as the conditions are satisfied). If Alice's party has enough people to create a coalition on her own, she can invite no parties.\nNote that Alice can either invite a party as a whole or not at all. It is not possible to invite only some of the deputies (seats) from another party.

Output two lines, first containing the integer $k$, and the second the space-separated indices $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k$. \nYou may print the parties in any order.

Note that she can also pick the third party or both of them. However, she cannot become prime minister without any of them, because $100$ is not a strict majority out of $200$.\nIn the second example, there is no way of building a majority, as both other parties are too large to become a coalition partner.\nIn the third example, Alice already has the majority. \nThe fourth example is described in the problem statement.\n\ndef",

The first and the last characters of $s$ both have only one adjacent character (unless $|s| = 1$).\nConsider the following example. Let $s=$ bacabcab.  During the first move, you can remove the first character $s_1=$ b because $s_2=$ a. Then the string becomes $s=$ acabcab.

The last one to be pointed at by the leader becomes the new leader.\nYou are given numbers l_1, l_2,..., l_{m} \u2014 indices of leaders in the beginning of each step. Child with number l_1 is the first leader in the game. \nWrite a program which will restore a possible permutation a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}. If there are multiple solutions then print any of them. If there is no solution then print -1.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100).\nThe second line contains m integer numbers l_1, l_2,..., l_{m} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 indices of leaders in the beginning of each step.\n-----Output-----\nPrint such permutation of n numbers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} that leaders in the game will be exactly l_1, l_2,..., l_{m} if all the rules are followed. If there are multiple solutions print any of them. \nIf there is no permutation which satisfies all described conditions print -1.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n2 3 1 4 4\nOutput\n3 1 2 4 \nInput\n3 3\n3 1 2\nOutput\n-1\n-----Note-----\nLet's follow leadership in the first example:   Child 2 starts.  Leadership goes from 2 to 2 + a_2 = 3.  Leadership goes from 3 to 3 + a_3 = 5. As it's greater than 4, it's going in a circle to 1.  Leadership goes from 1 to 1 + a_1 = 4.  Leadership goes from 4 to 4 + a_4 = 8. Thus in circle it still remains at 4.\n\ndef",
