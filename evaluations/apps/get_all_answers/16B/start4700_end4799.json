There may be new contestants from this region who are joining ACM-ICPC for the very first time1. This problem serves as a tutorial for such contestants.\nFirst, let establish the fact that the problems posed in ICPC are not research problems where nobody on earth knows how to solve them efficiently. Some people (at least the problem authors) have solved these problems before. There can be more than one possible solution to these problems. As the contest has limited time (5 hours) and each problem has an associated time penalty, it is always beneficial to pick the easiest problem to solve first2.\nSome problems may look complicated but happen to have a small input size constraint $n$ that allows even a na\u00efve brute force solution to pass. Some other problems may look simple but standard textbook algorithm cannot be used to pass the time limit as the input size constraint $n$ is too big and one has to figure out the special properties that simplify the problem.\nIn the \u201cCompetitive Programming\u201d book3 that has been written specifically for preparing for programming contests such as ICPC, we have the following compilation of typical algorithm complexities found in programming contests:\n$t$\nalgorithm complexity for input size $n$\n1\n$O(n!)$\n2\n$O(2^n)$\n3\n$O(n^4)$\n4\n$O(n^3)$\n5\n$O(n^2)$\n6\n$O(n \\log _2 n)$\n7\n$O(n)$\nFor this problem, we ignore the constant factor and the lower terms hidden in the Big O notation, i.e. an $O(g(n))$ algorithm is assumed to perform exactly $g(n)$ operations.\nLet $m$ be the number of operations that the computer used in the contest4 can run in one second. Suppose $m = 100000000$ and the team is trying to solve a problem with a time limit of one second. If the team can devise an algorithm of type $t = 3$, i.e., a rather slow $O(n^4)$ algorithm, but the largest $n$ mentioned in the problem description is just $50$, then this algorithm is actually fast enough and will get \u201cAccepted\u201d since $50^4 = 6250000$ is less than (or equal to) $m$.\nHowever, if for another problem also with one second time limit, the team can only devise an algorithm of type $t = 5$, i.e. an $O(n^2)$ algorithm, but the largest $n$ mentioned in the problem description is $10001$, then this algorithm is likely not fast enough to pass the time limit and will get \u201cTime Limit Exceeded\u201d, since $10001^2 = 100020001$ which is greater than $m$.\n Formally, given three integer parameters $m$ $(1 \\le m \\le 10^9)$, $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 10^9)$, and $t \\in [1..7]$, decide if an algorithm of type $t$ with time complexity as described in the table above can pass the time limit of one second, that is, performs less than (or equal to)$m$ operations.

It is played on a $4 \\times 4$ grid that contains integers $\\geq 2$ that are powers of 2. The player can use a keyboard arrow key (left/up/right/down) to move all the tiles simultaneously. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Please observe this merging behavior carefully in all Sample Inputs and Outputs.\n-----Input-----\nThe input is always a valid game state of a 2048 puzzle. The first four lines of input, that each contains four integers, describe the 16 integers in the $4 \\times 4$ grid of 2048 puzzle. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line denotes the content of the cell located at the $i$-th row and the $j$-th cell. For this problem, all integers in the input will be either {0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024}. Integer 0 means an empty cell.\nThe fifth line of input contains an integer 0, 1, 2, or 3 that denotes a left, up, right, or down move executed by the player, respectively.\n-----Output-----\nOutput four lines with four integers each. Two integers in a line must be separated by a single space. This describes the new state of the $4 \\times 4$ grid of 2048 puzzle. Again, integer 0 means an empty cell.

The process is simple: he just needs to input a given number of molecules of type A, enter the output type B he desires and start the machine. It creates as many molecules of type B as possible. Unfortunately, professor Cadmium was jealous of his work and tried to sabotage the machine by inverting wires on his machine. Professor Cesium, alerted by one of his assistants, was able to repair the mistake. To detect any problem in the future, he is asking you to create an automatic way to compute the number of molecules that the machine should output. With this algorithm, he is able to detect whether his precious machine was tampered with.\nMolecules are written as strings composed of uppercase letters (A\u2013Z) and numbers. Uppercase letters represent atoms. Note that Cesium only uses single letters of the alphabet as abbreviations for atoms, so H, C, A, X, Y, \u2026can be used but He, Mg, \u2026cannot.

Their new effort is a password system used to hide a password inside another string of characters we denote as a message. However, it is important that the message has a certain property relative to the hidden password.\nLet us assume that we denote the characters of the password as $ c_1 c_2 \\ldots c_ P$ (although those characters need not be distinct). To be a valid message for the password, if you start from the beginning of the message and search for any character from the set $\\{ c_1, \\ldots, c_ P \\} $, it must be that $c_1$ is the first that you find. Subsequently, if you continue looking from that point of the message for any character from the set $\\{ c_2, \\ldots, c_ P \\} $, it must be that $c_2$ is the next that you find. Continuing in that manner, $c_3$ must be the next character from the set $\\{ c_3, \\ldots, c_ P\\} $, and so on until reaching $c_ P$.\nFor example, if the password is ABC, then the string HAPPYBIRTHDAYCACEY is a valid message.\n - Notice that A is the first of the set $\\{ $A, B, C$\\} $ to appear in the message. (The initial H is not relevant.)\n - Following the A that was found, the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $B, C$\\} $ is B.\n - Following the B that was found, the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $C$\\} $ is indeed C.\n (Note that the A in DAY is not relevant, since we are only looking for a C at this point, and the additional A and C in CACEY are not relevant, because we have already completed the password with the first C.)\nHowever, for the password ABC, the string TRAGICBIRTHDAYCACEY is not a valid message.\n - While the A is the first of the set $\\{ $A, B, C$\\} $ to appear in the string,\n the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $B, C$\\} $ is C rather than B.\nAlso, the string HAPPYBIRTHDAY is not a valid message for the password ABC because the C never appears.\nAs an example with duplicate letters in the password, consider the password SECRET. For this password, the string SOMECHORESARETOUGH is a valid message. In contrast, the string SOMECHEERSARETOUGH is not a valid message, because an extraneous E is found at the point when an R is first expected.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing two strings.

For example, a deck consisting of eight cards ABCDEFGH (where A is the top card of the deck) would be divided into two halves ABCD and EFGH and then interleaved to get AEBFCGDH. Note that in this shuffle the original top card (A) stays on top \u2014 this type of perfect shuffle is called an out-shuffle. An equally valid perfect shuffle would start with the first card from the second half and result in EAFBGCHD \u2014 this is known as an in-shuffle.\nWhile normal shuffling does a good job at randomizing a deck, perfect shuffles result in only a small number of possible orderings. For example, if we perform multiple out-shuffles on the deck above, we obtain the following: ABCDEFGH $\\rightarrow $ AEBFCGDH $\\rightarrow $ ACEGBDFH $\\rightarrow $ ABCDEFGH $\\rightarrow \\cdots $\nSo after 3 out-shuffles, the deck is returned to its original state. A similar thing happens if we perform multiple in-shuffles on an 8-card deck, though in this case it would take 6 shuffles before we get back to where we started. With a standard 52 card deck, only 8 out-shuffles are needed before the deck is returned to its original order (talented magicians can make use of this result in many of their tricks). These shuffles can also be used on decks with an odd number of cards, but we have to be a little careful: for out-shuffles, the first half of the deck must have 1 more card than the second half; for in-shuffles, it\u2019s the exact opposite. For example, an out-shuffle on the deck ABCDE results in ADBEC, while an in-shuffle results in CADBE.\nFor this problem you will be given the size of a deck and must determine how many in- or out-shuffles it takes to return the deck to its pre-shuffled order.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of one line containing a positive integer $n \\leq 1000$ (the size of the deck) followed by either the word in or out, indicating whether you should perform in-shuffles or out-shuffles.\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output the case number followed by the number of in- or out-shuffles required to return the deck to its original order.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n8 out\nSample Output 1:\n3\nSample Input 2:\n8 in\nSample Output 2:\n6\nSample Input 3:\n52 out\nSample Output 3:\n8\n\ndef",

      "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:In the past century, a new style of music composition has emerged. Unlike more traditional methods based on keys and chords, the technique known as dodecaphony focuses on using all twelve notes equally. As a quick reminder, the twelve notes, in ascending order are,\\[ C, C\\sharp, D, D\\sharp, E, F, F\\sharp, G, G\\sharp, A, A\\sharp, B \\]\nThe sequence then wraps around so that the next note after $B$ is $C$ and so on. For this problem, we\u2019ll ignore equivalent notations that use flats, double sharps, or double flats.\nEach successive note above is considered one semitone away from the next. Now in our simplified version of dodecaphony, a melody is a permutation of the previous melody by one of three relations.\nFirst, we have transposition, where each note has been shifted up by $n$ semitones. A retrograde is when the notes have their order reversed. Finally we have inversion about the first note of the melody. With inversions, the first note doesn\u2019t change, but the rest of the notes are inverted such that the the interval (number of semitones) between that note and the first note is negated.\nFor example, if $F$ is our first note, and we want to invert an $A\\sharp $, which is $5$ semitones higher, the inverted note would be a $C$, which is $5$ semitones lower. Note that the first note in an inverted melody is always just the first note of the original melody.\nGiven two melodies, can you tell what relation the second has to the first?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer $2 \\leq l \\leq 50$, the number of notes in each melody.\nThe next two lines each contain $l$ space separated notes.

Looking ahead to 2018 they are beginning to embrace the more data-driven analysis of player\u2019s values known as Sabermetrics.\nFor example, a player\u2019s batting average is calculated by dividing the total number of base hits by the total number of official at-bats. One limitation of using the batting average to evaluate players is that it treats all hits equally, rather than taking into account doubles, triples or home runs. For this reason, analysts often prefer to consider what is known as the slugging percentage, which distinguishes between different hit outcomes. To calculate the slugging percentage, the total number of bases of all hits is divided by the total numbers of time at bat, that did not result in walks, or at-bats.\nMore specifically, an at-bat can earn $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$ or $4$ bases (these are referred to as official at-bats). Furthermore, some at-bats, such as those that result in a base-on-balls (i.e., a \u201cwalk\u201d) are not considered in either the player\u2019s batting average or slugging percentage.\nFor example, if a player hits a triple ($3$\u00a0bases), strikes out ($0$\u00a0bases), and hits a double ($2$\u00a0bases), their slugging percentage would be $\\frac{3+0+2}{3} \\approx 1.6667$. If a player hits a single ($1$\u00a0base), walks, and hits a home run ($4$\u00a0bases), the slugging level would be $\\frac{1 + 4}{2}=2.5$. Notice that in this case, the denominator is two, not three, because the walk does not count towards the slugging percentage.\n-----Input-----\nThe input is composed of two lines. The first line contains a single positive integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) that specifies the number of at-bats. The second line contains $n$ integers, separated by spaces, each describing one of those at-bats. Strike-outs, singles, doubles, triples, and home runs are represented as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. Walks are represented as -1. You may assume that there will always be at least one official at-bat (i.e., at least one at-bat will not be a walk).\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the player\u2019s slugging percentage as a real number, accurate to within an absolute or relative error of $10^{-3}$.

The secret to utilizing more dimensions turns out to be to use counting registers of different sizes. In particular, we have eight registers, counting cyclically modulo the different primes $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $11$, $13$, $17$, $19$. A size $p$ register stores a value between $0$ and $p-1$ (inclusive). \nThe only operation available is an \u201cincrement\u201d operation. When it is performed, the size $2$ register is increased by $1$. If this increment causes overflow (i.e., if the old value was $1$) the value is reset to $0$, and the size $3$ is incremented. If this causes overflow the size $3$ register is reset to $0$ and the size $5$ register is incremented, and so on. If this goes all the way to the last register and the size $19$ register overflows, the computer blows up.\nIn order not to destroy the computer in testing, we need to build a program to check the safety of doing increment operations before we perform them. Given the current state of the registers, you need to compute how many more operations can safely be performed before the computer blows up.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing eight integers $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_5$, $v_7$, $v_{11}$, $v_{13}$, $v_{17}$, $v_{19}$ indicating the current values of the registers.

Because there is no temporal data for the DNA samples, he is not concerned where the root of the tree is.\nDean considers the most likely evolutionary tree, the tree with smallest unlikeliness: the unlikeliness of a tree is defined as the sum of the weights of all edges, where the weight of an edge is the number of positions at which the two DNA strings are different.\nAs a world expert in data trees, he asks you to reconstruct the most likely evolutionary tree.\nIn the first sample, the optimal tree is AA - AT - TT - TC. The unlikeliness of the edge between AA and AT edge is $1$, because the strings AA and AT differ in exactly $1$ position.

However, before we go through that effort, it would be nice to know whether the boxes we have are the right size!\nA box has three dimensions, $l$, $w$, and $h$, and a box\u2019s volume $v$ is simply $l\\cdot w \\cdot h$. We have many small items to pack, and we don\u2019t care about their exact geometry: we know that, as long as a box has a volume of, at least, $\\mathbf{V}$, we will be able to pack all those items into that single box. So, given a box $i$, and its volume $v_ i$, then the difference $d_ i=v_ i-\\mathbf{V}$ can tell us whether the box is big enough or not to pack all the items. If $d_ i$ is greater than or equal to zero, the box is big enough; otherwise, the box is too small.\nSo, we want to answer a simple question: given multiple boxes, is the largest box (by volume) large enough to store all our items? For example, suppose $\\mathbf{V}=10$ and we have three boxes, $A$, $B$, and $C$, with dimensions $(1,1,2)$, $(2,2,2)$, and $(3,2,1)$, respectively. Their volumes will be $v_ A=2$, $v_ B=8$, and $v_ C=6$, which means the largest box is $B$. Unfortunately, $d_ B=v_ B-\\mathbf{V}=8-10=-2$, which means our largest box is not large enough.\nOn the other hand, suppose $\\mathbf{V}=980$, and we had four boxes, $W$, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ with dimensions $(10,10,10)$, $(10,5,2)$, $(5,3,2)$, and $(90,5,2)$, respectively. Their volumes will be $v_ W=1000$, $v_ X=100$, $v_ Y=30$ and $v_ Z=900$, making $W$ the largest box and, since $d_ W=v_ W-\\mathbf{V}=1000-980=20$, that means $W$ is big enough for all our items.\n-----Input-----\nThe input specifies a set of boxes. It begins with a line containing two integers: $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$), specifying the number of boxes, and $\\mathbf{V}$, as defined above. The remaining input is composed of $n$ lines, each specifying one box. Each line contains the dimensions $l$, $w$, and $h$ for the box.

The survey team has picked a route and has entrusted you with the job of transmitting the final set of instructions to the rover. This route is simply a sequence of moves in the cardinal directions: North, South, East, and West. These instructions can be sent using a string of corresponding characters: N, S, E, and W. However, receiving the signal drains the rover\u2019s power supply, which is already dangerously low. Fortunately, the rover\u2019s creators built in the ability for you to optionally define a single \u201cmacro\u201d that can be used if the route has a lot of repetition. More concretely, to send a message with a macro, two strings are sent. The first is over the characters {N,S,E,W,M} and the second is over {N,S,E,W}. The first string represents a sequence of moves and calls to a macro (M), while the second string determines what the macro expands out to. For example:WNMWMME\n EEN\nis an encoding ofWNEENWEENEENE\nNotice that the version with macros requires only $10$ characters, whereas the original requires $13$.\nGiven a route, determine the minimum number of characters needed to transmit it to the rover.\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a single line containing a non-empty string made up of the letters N, S, E, and W representing the route to transmit to the rover. The maximum length of the string is $100$.\n-----Input-----\nDisplay the minimum number of characters needed to encode the route.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nWNEENWEENEENE\nSample Output 1:\n10\nSample Input 2:\nNSEW\nSample Output 2:\n4\n\ndef",
