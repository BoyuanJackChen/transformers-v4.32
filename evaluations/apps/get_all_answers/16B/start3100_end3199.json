The leftovers should now be shipped to Singapore. There is, however, one constraint: In the case that one box of apples is infested with apple-eating insects and the next one in the line is also a box of apples, the insects might move on to the neighboring box and infect it as well. This constraint is applicable for boxes of cherries and boxes of mangos too.\nIn order to avoid this, ACM decides that the boxes of fruits are to be sent in such a way that two consecutive boxes contain different types of fruits. The statistics department of ACM wants to know how many ways there are to arrange the shipments of $A$ boxes of apples, $C$ boxes of cherries and $M$ boxes of mangos under this constraint.\nPlease provide a computer program to compute this for various choices of $A$, $C$, and $M$. Two arrangements are different if there exists $i$ such that the $i$-th box delivered in the two arrangements contain different types of fruits. Since the answer may be very big, output the answer modulo a prime number $10^9+7$.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line consisting of three single space separated integers $A$, $C$, and $M$, denoting the total number of boxes of apples, cherries, and mangos you need to ship to Singapore, respectively.

One of them is the booming Chinese market. When selling to potential Chinese buyers, it is often important to be culturally sensitive and realize that certain numbers and concepts carry significant meanings in their language, some good and others bad.\nIn particular,\n - the digit $4$ is to be avoided at all costs, as in Chinese \u201cfour\u201d sounds similar to the word \u201cdeath\u201d;\n - the digit $6$ is lucky, as in Chinese \u201csix\u201d sounds similar to the word \u201cflow\u201d, as in \u201cbusiness flowing smoothly\u201d;\n - the digit $8$ is lucky, as in Chinese \u201ceight\u201d sounds similar to the word \u201cwealth\u201d; however\n - according to yin and yang, one cannot have an extreme abundance of good things; a balance must be struck.\nTaking all the above into consideration, you\u2019ve chanced upon a street with a long row of houses, with house numbers from $L$ to $R$ from end to end, inclusive.

This art is typically made by taking a jar or bottle and filling it with layers of different colors of sand. Instead of a bottle, this year a new container is being used for decorating! The container is a glass box!\nThe box has a 2D rectangular face and a thickness of exactly 1 unit. Inside the glass box, $n-1$ vertical dividers are placed to separate it into $n$ sections. In the example below, the box is divided into 4 sections using 3 dividers:\nSometimes the children want certain amounts of each color to be in each section of their work of art. They specify a minimum and maximum for each combination of section and sand color. Your task is to help them find how balanced they can make the artwork. This is done by minimizing the difference between the sand heights in the section with the highest overall sand level and the section with the lowest overall sand level.\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs.

The $x$s are guaranteed to be sorted in increasing order.\nThe next $n$ lines will each have $m$ space-separated real numbers (with at most 3 decimal places) $min$ ($0 \\le min \\le w\\cdot h$).

Each conveyor belt transports any product automatically from one junction to another junction in exactly one minute. Note that each conveyor belt only works in one direction. There can be more than one conveyor belt connecting two junctions, and there can be a conveyor belt connecting a junction to itself.\nThere are $K$ producers (machines which produce the products) located at the first $K$ junctions, i.e. junctions $1, 2, \\ldots, K$. The producer at junction $j$ produces an product each minute $(x \\cdot K + j)$ for all integers $x \\ge 0$ and $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, K$. All products are transported immediately via the conveyor belts to the warehouse at junction $N$, except for those produced at junction $N$ (if any). Items produced at junction $N$ are directly delivered to the warehouse (there is no need to use the conveyor belts).\nAt each junction, there is a robot deciding which conveyor belts the incoming product should go to in a negligible time (instantly). The robots can be programmed such that all products produced by a producer are always delivered to the warehouse via the same route. Once the robots are programmed, the routing can no longer be changed. Items from different producers may have the same or different routes.\nA prudent potential investor comes and wants to inspect the factory before making any decision. You want to show to the potential investor that your factory employs a good risk management policy. Thus, you want to make sure that each conveyor belt only transports at most one product at any time; i.e. two products cannot be on the same conveyor belt at the same time. On the other hand, there is no limit on the number of products at the junctions (the robots have a lot of arms!). To achieve this, you may turn off zero or more producers, but you still want to maximize the production, hence, this problem.\nFind the maximum number of producers that can be left running such that all the produced products can be delivered to the warehouse and each conveyor belt transports at most $1$ product at any time.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers $N$, $K$, and $M$ ($1 \\le K \\le N \\le 300$; $0 \\le M \\le 1000$) representing the number of junctions, the number of producers, and the number of conveyor belts, respectively.\nThe next $M$ lines, each contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\le a, b \\le N$) representing a conveyor belt connecting junction $a$ and junction $b$ with the direction from $a$ to $b$.\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains an integer denoting the maximum number of producers which can be left running such that all the produced products can be delivered to the warehouse and each conveyor belt transports at most one product at any time.\n-----Explanation-----\nIn Sample Input $1$, $N = 4$, $K = 2$, $M = 3$, and the directed edges are $\\{ (1,3)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)\\} $. There is only one possible delivery route for each producer, i.e. $1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4$ for producer $1$, and $2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4$ for producer $2$. Both producers are using conveyor belt $(3,4)$, however, the products from producer $1$ are on the conveyor belt $(3,4)$ on minutes $2, 4, 6, \\dots $ (even minutes), while the products from producer $2$ are on the conveyor belt $(3,4)$ on minutes $3, 5, 7, \\dots $ (odd minutes). Therefore, both producers can be left running.\nIn Sample Input $2$, $N = 5$, $K = 2$, $M = 4$, and the directed edges are $\\{ (1,3)$, $(3,4)$, $(2,4)$, $(4,5)\\} $. Similar to the previous example, there is only one possible delivery route for each product produced by each producer.

Bj0rn is preparing to achieve top scores in \u201cGuitar Hero Live\u201d, but he needs your help in figuring out what the maximum score is for all the new songs. Apparently, the new game has something called Hero Power, but Bj0rn is betting that it really is the same thing as the \u201cStar Power\u201d that has always been in these games.\n\u201cGuitar Hero\u2019s\u201d scoring essentially works as follows: the player advances along a note chart and scores one point for each note he hits. Bj0rn will settle for nothing less than perfection; every note will be hit!\nHowever, there\u2019s an added twist: \u201cStar Power!\u201d\u2014simply called SP. Every now and then, a streak of star-shaped notes appear on the note chart. These streaks are SP phrases. When between the first and last note of an SP phrase, the player has the ability to charge up a so-called SP meter, which stores the amount of time the player has spent charging it. You can start charging at the exact moment of the first note and all the way up till the last note. You can also pause charging at any time and you do not have to use the accumulated SP immediately after you stop charging, so it is possible to accumulate SP charge from multiple phrases.\nWhen the SP meter contains a positive amount of seconds, at any point in the song\u2014even at the exact moment of a note\u2014the player is free to activate Star Power. From this moment, the SP meter starts draining until it is completely empty. For example, if it contains $\\pi + {\\root 4 \\of {7}}$ seconds of SP, it will take $\\pi + {\\root 4 \\of {7}}$ seconds to drain completely. During an activation, every note is worth two points as long as the SP meter is non-empty! In particular, if you start activating at the exact moment of a note, that note is already worth two points and if you hit a note during the last moment of activation, that note is only worth one point, because the SP meter has just become empty.\nThere is a downside to activating Star Power. If an SP activation overlaps with an SP phrase and the SP meter is positive at some point during the overlap, the SP phrase degrades back to plain notes. In particular, if you hit the first note of an SP phrase on the exact moment when the SP meter drains to $0$, the SP phrase is not degraded. It\u2019s fine to activate mid-phrase, but the rest of the phrase still suffers from the overlap and disappears, so you can not charge more Star Power from that phrase.\nCan you help Bj0rn find the best strategy and figure out how many points he can get?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of two integers $1 \\leq n \\leq 50000$ and $0 \\leq p \\leq 100$, the number of notes and SP phrases respectively. The second line is a strictly increasing sequence of $n$ integers $0 \\leq t_ i \\leq 50000000$, the positions of all notes in milliseconds. Then follow $p$ lines containing two integers each, $0 \\leq s_ i < e_ i \\leq 50000000$, the positions of the start and end of the $i$\u2019th Star Power phrase.\nNotes are guaranteed to exist on the start and end positions of each SP phrase.

This person is responsible for making sure that every team has an equal chance of winning the contest. Since last year\u2019s NWERC the current CEO, Gregor, has thought at length about how to make the contest even more fair and equal.\nHis answer is to introduce a new programming language as the only one allowed for submissions. This way, no team will be disadvantaged by not having mastered any of the allowed languages. This language is called Balloon, short for Building A Long List Of Ordinary Numbers. Its only data type is the list of integers. To keep the language fast, it contains only four instructions:\n - [x$_1$,\u2026,x$_ n$] is the constructor for lists. It returns the integers inside the brackets in their given order.\n - concat(<Expr$_1$>,<Expr$_2$>) returns a list of all the integers returned when evaluating the expression <Expr$_1$> followed by all of the integers returned when evaluating <Expr$_2$>.\n - shuffle(<Expr>) returns a list of all the integers returned by <Expr>, rearranged according to a uniformly random permutation, i.e., each permutation of the elements is used with equal probability.\n - sorted(<Expr>) returns a list of all the integers returned by <Expr>, rearranged into non-decreasing order.\nAs an example, consider the first expression of Sample Input 1. The two shuffle exressions both take the list [1,2] as input and return one of the lists [1,2] and [2,1], each with probability $0.5$ (independently of each other). The outer concat operator takes the two returned lists as its input and returns their concatenation. I.e., it returns one of the lists [1,2,1,2], [1,2,2,1], [2,1,1,2], and [2,1,2,1], each with probability $0.25$.\nNaturally, we cannot use byte-by-byte output comparison any more when teams submit their solutions in Balloon, as its output is probabilistic. The judge server instead has to check whether a submitted program is equivalent to the sample solution created by the judges. Two programs are equivalent if for any list $L$ of integers, both programs have an equal probability of returning $L$.\nIt is your task to determine whether two given Balloon programs are equivalent.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line containing a string A, the first program.\n - One line containing a string B, the second program.\nEach program is a syntactically valid Balloon program with between $3$ and $10^6$ characters, and contains neither spacing nor empty lists (i.e., the strings \u201c \u201d or \u201c[]\u201d do not occur in the input).\nEach integer in each program is greater than $0$ and less than $10^{9}$.\n-----Output-----\nIf the two programs are equivalent, output \u201cequal\u201d, otherwise output \u201cnot equal\u201d.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nconcat(shuffle([1,2]),shuffle([1,2]))\nshuffle([1,2,1,2])\nSample Output 1:\nnot equal\nSample Input 2:\nsorted(concat([3,2,1],[4,5,6]))\n[1,2,3,4,5,6]\nSample Output 2:\nequal\n\ndef",

Some weeks ago, they greatly impressed the other animals by forming a large tower. However, the frog king wants to surpass this performance at the next Benelux Amphibian Pillaring Ceremony (BAPC). He wants the frogs to perform a difficult dance which will end in a climax where all frogs form a tower. You have been appointed choreographer and will practice with the frogs in the following months.\nA frog dance is a form of line dance: a certain number of frogs line up and then perform a sequence of jumps, where every jump is either to the left or the right. The frog king decided to make this particular dance more interesting. Firstly, he dictated that the frogs have to increase the length of each jump. This means that for any frog, its first jump will be of length $1$, the second of length $2$, the third of length $3$, and so on. Secondly, the dance should end with all frogs on one big tower. Thirdly, the total number of jumps that the frogs make should be as low as possible, in order to make the dance flashy and impressive-looking.\nSince the king is a perfectionist, he wants the dance to be flawless. He has provided you with a team of excellent frog dancers, their starting positions, and the place he wants the frogs to form a tower at the end of the dance. However, the king still isn\u2019t convinced that the dance will be as perfect as he wants it to be, so he visits the rehearsal every day in order to make a change: he might find another frog that is very good at dancing and add it to the line-up, or he might feel that a frog is not good enough and remove him/her. He can even change the position of the final tower if he feels like it.\nAt the end of every day, the frog king wants to see the dance performed in the most efficient way possible, i.e. with the lowest total number of jumps.\n-----Input-----\n - A single line containing two integers $0 \\leq n \\leq 5000$ and $0\\leq t\\leq 10^6$, the initial number of frogs and the initial position of the frog tower.\n - The second line contains $n$ integers $0\\leq p_ i\\leq 10^6$, the starting positions of these frogs.\n - Then follows a line with an integer $0\\leq C\\leq 10^6$, the number of changes the king makes.\n - $C$ lines follow, each of one of the following three forms.\n - A line of the form $+$ $a$ indicates that the king adds a frog at position $a$.\n - A line of the form $-$ $a$ indicates that the king removes a frog from position $a$.

Before presenting this to your boss, you decide to make a program to test your claims. \nThe data you have gathered consists of the map of the network, as well as the length of each cable. While you do not know the exact time it takes to send a network packet across each cable, you know that it can be calculated as $\\ell / v + c$, where\n - $\\ell $ is the length of the cable,\n - $v$ is the propagation speed of the cable, and\n - $c$ is the overhead of transmitting the packet on and off the cable.\nYou have not been able to measure $v$ and $c$.

His Scotland Yard colleagues often provide him with a set of evidence and ask for his help in solving the mysteries. After many years of practice, Holmes has gained an enormous amount of experience and already knows causes for many common events, which, combined with his extraordinary deductive capabilities, enables him to solve cases in a matter of minutes, from the comfort of his chair.\nHolmes\u2019 knowledge base can be modeled as a set of implications of the form $A \\rightarrow B$ (where $A$ and $B$ represent events), which means that, if $A$ occurred, event $B$ must have also occurred (remember that logical implication is false only if $A$ is true and $B$ is false). Of course, implications can form chains of reasoning, e.g., $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$. However, there will never be a circular chain of implications (e.g., $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow A$).\nHolmes is given a set $S = \\{ S_1, S_2, S_3, \\ldots, S_ n \\} $ of events that are known to have occurred. He can then, using his extensive knowledge and deductive powers, find all events that have certainly occurred.\nIt\u2019s important to note that Holmes\u2019 knowledge is so mind-bogglingly huge that he knows all possible causes of events. In other words, there is no implication that is true, but not included in Holmes\u2019 knowledge base. This means that if an event $A$ occurred and $A$ is known to be implied by some other event(s), then at least one of those other event(s) must have occurred as well.\nMany detective agencies would highly appreciate Holmes\u2019 one of a kind capabilities, so you were given a task to accomplish with a computer what is out of reach for ordinary mortals. Write a program to find all events that have certainly occurred based on the given implications and evidence collected by your colleague detectives.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of three integers, $D$ ($1 \\le D \\le 1000$), the number of different types of events, $M$ ($1 \\le M \\le 100000$), the number of implications, and $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le D$), the number of events known to have occurred.\nEach of the $M$ lines that follow contains two integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \\le A, B \\le D$), describing an implication $A \\rightarrow B$.\nFinally, each of the last $N$ lines contains an integer $X$ ($1 \\le X \\le D$) describing an event that is known to have occurred, based on the evidence collected by detectives.\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output should contain integers (in increasing order) representing events that have certainly occurred.\n-----Explanation of sample cases-----\nIn Sample Input 2, the knowledge base contains implications $1 \\rightarrow 3$ and $2 \\rightarrow 3$. Therefore, Holmes knows that event $3$ can be caused only by events $1$ and $2$, but (without any extra information), he can\u2019t be certain which one of those events actually caused $3$. As a result, the only event that must have occurred is the one given in the input.\nIn Sample Input 3, Holmes doesn\u2019t know which event from the set $\\{ 2, 3\\} $ is directly responsible for event $4$. However, as both of those events are caused only by event $1$, Holmes can deduce that event $1$ must have occurred.

As they were not fully prepared for this, they have a map, but no GPS. The map lists all intersections.

In this problem, we consider a so called signed binary representation, in which we still write $n$ as $\\sum _{i=0}^{k} a_ i \\cdot 2^i$, but allow $a_ i$ to take on the values $-1$, $0$ and $1$. For instance, $n=13$ can be represented as\\[ (1, 0, 0, -1, -1) = 2^4 - 2^1 - 2^0. \\]\nThe binary representation of a number is unique, but obviously, the signed binary representation is not. In certain applications (e.g. in cryptography), one seeks to write a number $n$ in signed binary representation with as few non-zero digits as possible. For example, we consider the representation $(1, 0, 0, -1)$ to be a better representation of $n = 7$ than $(1, 1, 1)$. Your task is to write a program which will find such a minimal representation.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing a positive integer $n < 2^{100000}$ written in binary, without leading zeros.\n-----Output-----\nFor each line of input, output one line containing the signed binary representation of $n$ that has the minimal number of non-zero digits, using the characters \u2018-\u2019 for $-1$, \u20180\u2019 for $0$ and \u2018+\u2019 for $+1$.

Marguerite hopes that the book can keep the two girls busy for a while so that she can work on her other chores.\nSarah and Patricia need to know whether their calculated answers are right, but Marguerite does not have the time to check their work.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Many pharmacies in the United States fill prescriptions strictly on a first-come, first-served basis, even preferring prescriptions submitted electronically from a remote site to prescriptions dropped off by waiting customers in the store. This frequently leads to situations where customers have to wait for prescriptions because pharmacy technicians are busy filling prescriptions that may not be picked up until much later anyway.\nThis problem asks you to investigate the effect of an \u201cin-store customers first\u201d policy. Under this policy, technicians fill prescriptions in the order in which they are dropped off, but they will not start filling remote prescriptions as long as there are in-store prescriptions to be filled.\nWrite a program that computes the average completion time for in-store and remote customers under this policy!\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ ($0 < n \\le 100000$) and $t$ ($0 < T \\le 10$), where $n$ denotes the number of prescriptions and $T$ the number of technicians working at the pharmacy. This is followed by $n$ lines, one line per prescription.\nEach line consists of one integer $d$ ($0 < d \\le 10^9$), which is the time (in seconds) when the prescription was dropped off, followed by a single character \u2018R\u2019 or \u2018S\u2019 for a remote or in-store prescription, followed by a single integer $k$ ($0 < k \\le 500$) describing the number of seconds it takes a technician to fill this prescription. Prescriptions are listed in increasing order of drop-off time, but multiple prescriptions may be dropped off at the same time, in which case preference should be given to any in-store prescriptions, regardless of the order in which they appear in the input. If two prescriptions of the same type are dropped off at the same time, the prescription needing the shorter fill time must be filled first, again regardless of the order in which they appear in the input.\nOnce a technician starts working on a prescription, they will finish filling it, even if an in-store prescription is dropped off while they are working. Each prescription requires one pharmacy technician to fill it, and each technician can work on only one prescription at a time. The technicians work until all prescriptions are filled. You should ignore the time it would take for technicians to decide which prescription to fill next, so a technician who finishes a prescription can start working immediately on the next prescription.\n-----Output-----\nOutput two numbers $o$ and $r$, denoting the average completion time for in-store and remote prescriptions, respectively. A prescription\u2019s completion time is defined as the time difference between when a prescription was dropped off and when it was filled. If there were no in-store or remote prescriptions in the input, output $0$ for $o$ or $r$ instead.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:It is chaos playtime at kindergarten again, and teacher Tom is having some difficulties. You see, kids often have disagreements about who should play with which toy. Whenever a kid perceives any form of injustice in the allocation of toys to kids, they start crying uncontrollably. The kids are clearly poor decision makers, so today Tom has a new plan: rather than letting the kids choose toys by themselves, he will assign toys to them in a way that prevents any crying. \nTom has been studying the behavior of the kids and now understands exactly under what circumstances they start crying. First, a child will cry if they have no toy to play with. Second, even having a toy, a child $A$ will cry if there is some other child $B$ playing with some toy $T$ such that $A$ envies $B$ for playing with $T$, and $A$ would rather play with $T$ than with $A$\u2019s current toy. Additionally, Tom has observed the following four behavioural properties of children:\n - Envious: children envy those who have played more than them with any given toy. If child $A$ played strictly more with toy $T$ yesterday than child $B$ did, then $B$ will be envious of $A$ for playing with $T$ today.\n - Inflexible: a child would rather play with some toy it played with yesterday, and the earlier they first played with it yesterday, the more they want to play with it today. All toys that a child did not play with at all yesterday are equally (un)desirable to the child.\n - Cannot multitask: a child never plays with more than one toy at a time.\n - Uncooperative: children are bad at sharing, and two children never play with the same toy at the same time.\nTom has recorded which toys were played with by which kid yesterday, taking note of when each kid started playing with a toy. Using this information, Tom aims to make one fixed assignment of toys for all of today that, if possible, prevents any crying.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n,m \\leq 1000$), the number of kids and the number of toys. The kids are numbered from $1$ to $n$ and the toys from $1$ to $m$. Then follows a line containing two integers $d$ and $e$ ($1 \\leq d \\leq 10^9$ and $0 \\leq e \\leq 10^6$), the total duration of yesterday\u2019s playtime in microseconds and the number of events Tom recorded yesterday.\nThen follow $e$ lines giving the events Tom recorded yesterday. Each event is described by a line containing three integers $s$, $k$ and $t$ ($0 \\le s < d$, $1 \\le k \\le n$, and $0 \\le t \\le m$), indicating that kid $k$ started playing with toy $t$ at time $s$ (in microseconds since the start of yesterday\u2019s playtime). If $t = 0$ then kid $k$ stopped playing with any toy at time $s$.\nThe events are given in non-decreasing order of time (i.e., the values of $s$ are non-decreasing). All toy changes for all kids prior to playtime ending have been recorded by Tom (in particular if one kid $k_1$ steals a toy from some other kid $k_2$, there is also an event indicating $k_2$\u2019s change of toy at the same microsecond, even if $k_2$ stops playing with any toy). At the start of the playtime, no kid is playing with any toy (but they can start playing with a toy at time $0$). At time $d$ all kids still playing with toys stopped playing with them but Tom did not record these events. Kids do not switch toys more than once per microsecond.\n-----Output-----\nIf there is an assignment of toys to kids such that no kid will start crying today, output $n$ distinct integers, the $i^{\\text {th}}$ of which is the toy that kid $i$ should play with. If there are multiple possible solutions, output any one of them.

During this grand voyage, she was accompanied by her fluffy friend, Mr.\u00a0Fluffynose the Stuffed Animal. However, after her return, it seems that she has left him somewhere along the route! This is devastating news for your little sister, and as she won\u2019t stop crying about it, you decide to retrace her steps through town. \nYou know that your sister will hold on to her beloved Fluffynose whenever possible, so the only time she could\u2019ve lost it is when she grabbed an item on her shopping list. So, all you have to do is figure out at what store she bought what, and then you\u2019ll reunite her with her counterpart in no time! However, you soon find out that this isn\u2019t quite as easy as you thought: she went to a lot of stores, and although she knows the names of the stores she went to and the order in which she visited them, she does not recall what she bought at each store (it could have been nothing!). It would take a lot of time to blindly search all the stores for all these items. As you have better things to do today, like solving programming problems, you want to spend as little time on this retrieval as possible. Therefore, you want to know exactly which items your sister bought at each store before you start your search.\nFor this you have two pieces of information: firstly you know the inventory of all stores your sister went to. Secondly, you know exactly in what order she purchased the groceries, as she has very carefully stacked all items into her bag. You decide to number the stores your sister visited according to the order in which she visited them. Given this information, you want to decide whether you know for sure where she bought every item so you can retrace her steps as efficiently as possible.\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with a line with a single integer $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$, the number of supermarkets in town. Then follows a line with an integer $N\\leq K \\leq 100000$, after which $K$ lines follow with a space-separated integer $i$ (between $0$ and $N-1$) and a string $S$ (consisting of only lowercase letters, at most $10$), denoting that item $S$ is available at the $i^\\text {th}$ store that your sister visited. It is guaranteed that every store has at least one item, every item is available at at least one store, and that every item occurs at most once at every store.\nThe second part of the input contains the list of items your sister bought, in order of purchase. It starts with a line with an integer $M\\leq K$, the number of items your sister has bought. Then follow $M$ lines, each with string $T$, denoting the name of the item your sister bought. The items are given in the order she purchased them in.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:With the advent of touch-screen based interfaces, software designers have had to reinvent computer control for finger-based gestures. The most basic task in interpreting a gesture is classifying the touches into one of several possible gestures. This can be difficult because the touches are really blobs of pixels on the screen (not unique points), and gestures involve movement.\nWe define a touch as a connected set of pixels. A pair of pixels is part of the same touch if they are horizontally or vertically adjacent. The touch point is the position of a touch. It\u2019s defined as the average location of all pixels that are in the set.\nA grip is the set of all touch points for an image. The grip point is the average location of all touch points in the grip. For each touch point we define its touch vector as the vector from the grip point to the touch point. A gesture is a pair of grips (initial and final), and both grips have the same number of touches. There is a one-to-one correspondence between touches in the initial and final grip. The correspondence is chosen such that the sum of squared distances between corresponding touch points is minimized.\nThere are three kinds of gestures: pan, zoom, and rotation. There is a distance associated with each kind. The pan distance is measured between the two grip points. The grip spread is the average distance between each touch point and the grip point. The zoom distance is the difference between the two grip spreads. The touch rotation is the signed angle (in $[-\\pi, \\pi ]$ radians) between the two touch vectors for corresponding touch points. The grip rotation is the average touch rotation. The rotation distance is the arc length of the grip rotation along a circle with radius equal the grip spread of the initial grip.\nYou need to classify the gestures based whether it is a pan, zoom, or rotation. Pick the one which has the greatest associated distance.\n-----Input-----\nInput is one pair of images, given side-by-side. Both images are $15\\times 30$ pixels, and there will be a single space on each line separating the two images. Each image uses X to represent pixels of a touch, and a period (.) to represent no touch. Both images have the same number of touches, between 1 and 5.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of touches and the type of gesture (pan, zoom, or rotate) as well as the direction of the gesture for zoom or rotate. The direction for a zoom is in if the grip spread of the final grip is smaller than that of the initial grip, otherwise it is out. The direction of a rotate is either clockwise or counter-clockwise. All distance comparisons that affect the output will be robust against numerical error of $10^{-5}$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n............................................................\n............................................................\n....XXXX....................................................\n....XXXX..................................XXXX..............\n....XXXX...................................XXX..............\n............................................................\n............................................................\n............................................................\n............................................................\n............................................................\n............................................................\n............................................................\n............................................................\n............................................................\n............................................................\nSample Output 1:\n1 pan\nSample Input 2:\n............................................................\n............................................................\n...............................................XX...........\n.....................................XXX......XXXX..........\n....................................XXXX........X...........\n........XXX....XXX....................X.....................\n.........XXX...XX...........................................\n............................................................\n............XX..............................................\n...........XXX..............................................\n............................................................\n............................................XX..............\n...........................................XXXX.............\n.............................................XX.............\n............................................................\nSample Output 2:\n3 zoom out\n\ndef",

Josip already has an idea of how each pixel will be coloured.\nThis would be no problem if Josip\u2019s painting process wasn\u2019t strange.

The vertical wire numbered $1$ lies along the left edge of the panel, and the horizontal wire numbered $1$ lies along the bottom edge of the panel.\nA pixel will activate, turning dark, when a current is present along both the vertical and horizontal wire passing through that pixel.\nFor a period of time, we will send pulses of current down selected wires.

Since Sweden is the fairest country on earth, they wanted to ensure that the ranking of all the players is perfectly fair. Therfore, they decided that every high school student in the nation should play against every other high school student. Sadly, when all the matches were done, it turned out that ranking the players in a fair manner was hard, or even impossible; sometimes it was the case that a player $a$ had beat some other player $b$, player $b$ had beat some player $c$ and player $c$ had beat player $a$. Regardless of which ranking the Swedish experts suggested, someone was treated unfairly in the sense that they were ranked below someone they had beaten. The Swedish king thus decided to disqualify some players, so that there would be no ambiguity in the ranking among the remaining players. His experts then came up with a set $S$ of $k$ players to disqualify. Unfortunately, you are one of these disqualified players.\nTogether with the other disqualified players, you plead with the king to make him undo his decision. While he remains firm in the belief that his approach will yield a fair ranking, he has offered your group a deal: If you can find a set $S\u2019$ containing strictly less than $k$ players to disqualify instead of your own group, then the king will disqualify this group instead. The group $S$ of disqualified players has now bestowed upon you the responsibility of finding that different group $S\u2019$. They require that none of the originally disqualified players are in $S\u2019$, and that the group you suggest is as small as possible.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two positive integers, $n$ the number of high school students, and $k$ the number of disqualified players.

Finally, there is a line with $k$ integers indicating the set $S$, the players who were disqualified. Each player is identified by a number between $0$ and $n-1$. You may assume that, when the disqualified players $S$ are removed, there exists a fair ranking of the remaining players. A fair ranking is one such that nobody is ranked below someone they beat. We remark that even though the Swedish experts couldn\u2019t find a fair ordering of all the players, there might still be one.

Almost all versions of this story proudly point out that the roundness of the Round Table is closely related to Arthur\u2019s belief of equality among the Knights. That is a lie! In fact, Arthur\u2019s choice of table is conditioned by his childhood traumas.\nIn fact, Arthur was forced to clean up quadratic tables from a young age after a tournament in pick-up sticks1 had been played on them. After the tournament, typically there would be a bunch of sticks on the table that do not touch each other. In the spirit of the game, the organizers issued strict regulations for the table cleaners. More precisely, the sticks on the table need to be removed one by one in a way that the cleaners pull them in the shortest way towards the edge of the table closest to where they are currently sitting. They also mustn\u2019t rotate or touch the other sticks while doing this (not even in the edge points).\nIn this task, we will represent the table in the coordinate system with a square that has opposite points in the coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(10000, 10000)$, whereas the sticks will be represented with straight line segments that lie within that square. We will assume that Arthur is sitting at the edge of the table lying on the $x$-axis. Then the movement of the stick comes down to translating the line segment along the shortest path towards the $x$-axis until the stick falls off the table (as shown in the image). It is your task to help Arthur determine the order of stick movements that meets the requirements from the previous paragraph.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 5000$), the number of sticks on the table. Each of the following $N$ lines contains four integers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$ ($0 \\leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \\leq 10000$) that denote the edge points of a stick.\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain space-separated stick labels in the order which they need to be taken off the table.

Trash is played with a standard $52$-card deck consisting of Ace, $2$ to $10$, Jack, Queen, and King in each of the $4$ suits. Each player is dealt $10$ cards face down that are arranged in $2$ rows for each player as shown in the figure. The first row represents slots for an ace, a $2$, a $3$, a $4$, and a $5$ of any suit, the second row represents slots for $6$, $7$, $8$, $9$, $10$ of any suit. The first player who can fill all $10$ of their slots with a card of the appropriate kind wins.\nPlayers take turns to play Trash. At the beginning of each turn, a player draws from the drawing pile, which initially contains all cards that have not been dealt face-down. If the player can use the card drawn to fill one of their slots that has not been filled, they uncover and remove the face-down card from the slot and put the drawn card face up in the slot. Then, the player repeats their turn with the card uncovered (instead of drawing a new card from the drawing pile) until they either fill all slots or uncover a card that cannot fill a slot.\nIf a player draws or uncovers a card that cannot fill any slot (such as a Queen or King), or if a player draws or uncovers a card that corresponds to a slot they\u2019ve already filled, that card is put on the discard pile and the player loses their turn. Then, the other player takes their turn or turns by first drawing from the drawing pile, then placing cards as long as they fill slots. Note that in this version of Trash, a player may never take any cards from the discard pile. Whichever player first fills all of their slots wins.\nA special case is the Jack, which acts as a wildcard. Whenever a player draws (or uncovers) a Jack, they can use the Jack to fill any of their remaining slots.\nTheta quickly discovers that it matters how you use any Jacks you draw, namely so that you minimize the chance of being left with an unfilled slot. If there are multiple optimal choices for slots in which to place a Jack, she chooses the lowest-numbered slot (Ace counts as $1$). Most of her friends, however, use a simpler strategy of always using their Jacks to fill the lowest-numbered unfilled slot, regardless of which cards were already placed or discarded.\nWrite a program that determines who wins in a game between Theta and one of her friends! Note that Theta bases her decision on only those cards that are turned face-up in a slot and the cards that have been discarded onto the discard pile, but not the face-down cards or the cards remaining in the drawing pile.\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a single string denoting the shuffled deck, which consists of $52$ characters, with each of A, J, Q, K, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and T appearing exactly $4$ times. Since the suit of a card does not matter for the game, it is not given in the input. 2 - 9 stand for cards $2$ to $9$, T stands for $10$, and A, J, Q, and K stand for Ace, Jack, Queen, and King.\nThe first $10$ cards in the deck are dealt face-down to Theta, with the first card in her Ace/$1$ slot, the second card in her $2$ slot, and so on. The next $10$ cards are dealt to her friend, with the $11^{\\texttt{th}}$ in the Ace/$1$ slot, and so on. The $21^{\\texttt{st}}$ card in the deck is the first card drawn. Neither player is allowed to look at their face-down cards. Theta starts the game.\nYou are guaranteed that one player will be able to win before the deck runs out of cards.\n-----Output-----\nIf Theta wins this game with her strategy, output \u201cTheta wins\u201d.

To secure a revered lifetime appointment as antenna calibrator for the dank.nt.nu pirate radio station (broadcasted live from the Gl\u00f8shaugen catacombs every night at 00:13:37 CET), you have been challenged to produce a $256$-minute feature revealing the character type of each candidate.\nIt is well known any candidate is either a truther, who always tells the truth, a fabulist, who never tells the truth, or a charlatan, who starts any debate speaking truthfully, but eventually switches to uttering only falsehoods. (Precisely, a charlatan first utters one or more true statements, then she utters one or more false statements, and that is all.)\nNow, as should be expected candidates talk nothing about printer maintenance policy, but about only each other\u2019s character types.

Currently, there is not a single road in this country, so the prime minister decided to modernize the country by connecting some cities with two-way highways and form counties. Two cities will be located in the same county if it is possible to get to one city from the other using the newly built roads. Each city will be located in exactly one county. Each county consists of one or more cities.\nThe cities are represented as points in a two-dimensional coordinate system. The road between two cities is represented as a line segment connecting two points where the cities are located. The length of the road is equal to the length of the line segment in kilometers.\nThe country is currently suffering from recession, so the prime minister decided that, because of the lack of budget, they will not build roads longer than $D$ kilometers. Additionally, the prime minister is happy about the small things, so he will be happy if, in at least one county, there exists a nonempty subset of cities (it can include all cities in the county) where the total sum of residents is divisible by $K$. For instance, if $K = 4$ and there is a county with cities that have $3$, $5$, $7$ residents respectively, the prime minister will be happy because the sum of residents in the first two cities is equal to $8$.\nHelp the prime minister in cutting the costs by determining the minimal $D$ such that the prime minister can build roads and be happy about the small things at the same time.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 50000$, $1 \\leq K \\leq 30$). Each of the following $N$ lines contains three integers $x_ i$, $y_ i$, $k_ i$ ($0 \\leq x_ i, y_ i, k_ i \\leq 100000000$), that represent the x coordinate of the city, the y coordinate and the number of residents in that city, respectively. There will not be two cities with the same coordinates in the input data. Additionally, there will not be a single city with the number of residents divisible by $K$.\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the minimal $D$ such that it is possible to build roads with the condition that the prime minister is happy.

For example, Valles Marineris on Mars is a vast canyon system running along the Martian equator and is roughly the size of the United States.\nWorking for a prestigious mapping company, you\u2019ve been tasked with making maps for such canyons. A canyon can be represented in 2D by a simple polygon outline. The maps you will be constructing will be perfectly square and axis aligned. This is due to the mapping company\u2019s desire that tops of their maps are always North. In order to increase the detail, sometimes multiple maps are used to cover just one canyon. Such a collection is called a mapping system. The mapping system of the canyon must cover the entire area of the canyon. The maps in the mapping system must also be the same scale with respect to the canyon and the same size with respect to their printing. This allows the maps to be easily compared when viewed together.\nYour mapping system will have exactly $k$ maps. You need to find a mapping system that completely covers the canyon, but each map covers as little area as possible, since a map with less area can be shown at a higher detail. All of the maps must be perfectly square, and must cover the same amount of area on the canyon. The maps can overlap. Since area is the square of side length, just output the side length for simplicity. If things go well enough, your mapping system may even be used to map Valles Marineris in the near future.\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each input begins with a line with two space-separated integers $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2000$) and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le 3$), where $n$ is the number of vertices in the polygon, and $k$ is the number of square maps in the mapping system. The next $n$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $x$ $y$ ($-20000 \\le x, y \\le 20000$). These are the coordinates of the polygon, in order. No two edges of the polygon will intersect. All points will be distinct. No three consecutive points will be collinear. The polygon will be a simple polygon which does not touch or cross itself.

Surely some variation could not hurt? \nIn order to draw more support and make their unhappiness known to the municipality, a group of citizens has agreed to gather at an intersection of the city to protest.

There are many ways in which code can produce different behavior between debug and release builds, and when this happens, one may have to resort to more primitive forms of debugging. \nSo you and your printf are now on your own in the search for a line of code that causes the release build to crash. Still you are lucky: adding printf statements to this program affects neither the bug (it still crashes at the same original code line) nor the execution time (at least not notably). So even the naive approach of putting a printf statement before each line, running the program until it crashes, and checking the last printed line, would work.\nHowever, it takes some time to add each printf statement to the code, and the program may have a lot of lines. So perhaps a better plan would involve putting a printf statement in the middle of the program, letting it run, seeing whether it crashes before the added line, and then continuing the search in either the first or second half of the code.\nBut then again, running the program may take a lot of time, so the most time-efficient strategy might be something in between.

So if the light goes from red to green at time $T$, she knows it will stay green until (but not including) $T+T_ g$, then go yellow until (but not including) $T+T_ g+T_ y$ and finally stay red until (but not including) $T+T_ g+T_ y+T_ r$, at which point it will turn green again. However, she does not know $T$, the time at which the traffic light cycle starts. Based on her observations, she can deduce what values of $T$ are (im)possible. Assuming that all possible values of $T$ that are consistent with her observations are equally likely, can you compute the probability that the lights will be green at a certain time?\n-----Input-----\n - The first line contains three positive integers $T_ g$ $T_ y$ $T_ r$, corresponding to the duration (in seconds) for which the lights stay green, yellow, and red ($0 < T_ g,T_ y,T_ r \\leq 10^8$).\n - The second line contains a single positive integer $n$, the number of times Sarah looked at the lights ($3 \\leq n < 1000$).\n - Each of the next $n$ lines contains one integer $0\\leq t \\leq 10^9$ followed by a color $c$: the time (in seconds) of the observation and color of the lights at that moment. The times of the observations are given in strictly increasing order. Sarah did see the lights being each color (green, yellow, and red) at least once.\n - The last line contains an integer $ 0 \\leq t_ q \\leq 10^9$ and a color $c_ q$. These specify the question asked: What is the probability of the lights being color $c_ q$ at time $t_ q$?\n-----Output-----\n - $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$, the probability of the lights being color $c_ q$ at time $t_ q$. Your answer is considered correct if it has absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-3}$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 4 4\n3\n2 green\n18 yellow\n34 red\n5 green\nSample Output 1:\n0.25\nSample Input 2:\n4 4 4\n4\n2 green\n6 yellow\n10 red\n14 green\n4 red\nSample Output 2:\n0\n\ndef",

Archaeologists from a distant planet have recently discovered Earth. Among many other things, they want to decipher the English language.\nThey have collected many printed documents to form a dictionary, but are aware that sometimes words are not spelled correctly (typos are a universal problem). They want to classify each word in the dictionary as either correct or a typo. Na\u00efvely, they do this using a simple rule: a typo is any word in the dictionary such that deleting a single character from that word produces another word in the dictionary.\nHelp these alien archaeologists out! Given a dictionary of words, determine which words are typos. That is, which words result in another word in the dictionary after deleting a single character.\nFor example if our dictionary is $\\{ \\texttt{hoose}, \\texttt{hose}, \\texttt{nose}, \\texttt{noises}\\} $. Then hoose is a typo because we can obtain hose by deleting a single \u2019o\u2019 from hoose. But noises is not a typo because deleting any single character does not result in another word in the dictionary.\nHowever, if our dictionary is $\\{ \\texttt{hoose}, \\texttt{hose}, \\texttt{nose}, \\texttt{noises}, \\texttt{noise}\\} $ then the typos are hoose, noises, and noise.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $n$, indicating the number of words in the dictionary.\nThe next $n$ lines describe the dictionary.
