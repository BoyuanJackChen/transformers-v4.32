On the Bracketology lessons students usually learn different sequences that consist of round brackets (characters \"(\" and \")\" (without quotes)).\nOn the last lesson Anton learned about the regular simple bracket sequences (RSBS). A bracket sequence s of length n is an RSBS if the following conditions are met:\n  It is not empty (that is n \u2260 0).  The length of the sequence is even.  First $\\frac{n}{2}$ charactes of the sequence are equal to \"(\".  Last $\\frac{n}{2}$ charactes of the sequence are equal to \")\". \nFor example, the sequence \"((()))\" is an RSBS but the sequences \"((())\" and \"(()())\" are not RSBS.\nElena Ivanovna, Anton's teacher, gave him the following task as a homework. Given a bracket sequence s. Find the number of its distinct subsequences such that they are RSBS. Note that a subsequence of s is a string that can be obtained from s by deleting some of its elements. Two subsequences are considered distinct if distinct sets of positions are deleted.\nBecause the answer can be very big and Anton's teacher doesn't like big numbers, she asks Anton to find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\nAnton thought of this task for a very long time, but he still doesn't know how to solve it.

The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.\nThere are n teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of n\u00b7(n - 1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium.

So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.\nThe street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length.

At time $t$ ($0 \\le t$) depth at $i$ meters from the shore equals $d_i + p[t \\bmod 2k]$ ($t \\bmod 2k$ denotes the remainder of the division of $t$ by $2k$). Note that the changes occur instantaneously after each second, see the notes for better understanding. \nAt time $t=0$ Koa is standing at the shore and wants to get to the island.

In other words, $d_x + p[t \\bmod 2k] \\le l$ must hold always.\n  Once Koa reaches the island at $n+1$ meters from the shore, she stops and can rest.\nNote that while Koa swims tide doesn't have effect on her (ie. she can't drown while swimming). Note that Koa can choose to stay on the shore for as long as she needs and neither the shore or the island are affected by the tide (they are solid ground and she won't drown there). \nKoa wants to know whether she can go from the shore to the island. Help her!\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.

Let's describe a possible solution:\n  Initially at $t = 0$ the beach looks like this: $[\\underline{s}, 1, 0, i]$.  At $t = 0$ if Koa would decide to swim to $x = 1$, beach would look like: $[s, \\underline{2}, 1, i]$ at $t = 1$, since $2 > 1$ she would drown. So Koa waits $1$ second instead and beach looks like $[\\underline{s}, 2, 1, i]$ at $t = 1$.  At $t = 1$ Koa swims to $x = 1$, beach looks like $[s, \\underline{1}, 0, i]$ at $t = 2$. Koa doesn't drown because $1 \\le 1$.  At $t = 2$ Koa swims to $x = 2$, beach looks like $[s, 2, \\underline{1}, i]$ at $t = 3$. Koa doesn't drown because $1 \\le 1$.  At $t = 3$ Koa swims to $x = 3$, beach looks like $[s, 1, 0, \\underline{i}]$ at $t = 4$.  At $t = 4$ Koa is at $x = 3$ and she made it! \nWe can show that in test case $2$ Koa can't get to the island.\n\ndef",

This game is similar to the \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\" game: both robots secretly choose a number from the set {1, 2, 3} and say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number, then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. \nBoth robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (i + 1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in i-th game. \nIlya knows that the robots will play k games, Alice will choose number a in the first game, and Bob will choose b in the first game.
