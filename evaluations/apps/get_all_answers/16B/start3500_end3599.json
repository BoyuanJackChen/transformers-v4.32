        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Bingo is a game of chance played by a group of players. Each player has his or her own bingo card with a $5$-by-$5$ grid of numbers. Each number appears at most once per card. The bingo caller calls out a sequence of randomly drawn numbers, and the players mark the numbers that appear on their card as they are called out. The winner is the player that completes a line of five marked numbers (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) on his or her card. The winning player then yells \u201cbingo\u201d and the game ends.\nYou have been volunteering with a local youth group and have been running bingo games for the children. They love bingo, but every time two or more kids yell \u201cbingo\u201d at the same time, a spirited \u201cdisagreement\u201d breaks out. You\u2019ve created a slightly modified version of bingo (in the hopes of introducing fewer ties): the cards are $5$-by-$5$ grids with a number from $1$ to $3000$ in each of the $25$ cells, and a winner is only declared when a player has $5$ numbers in a row. Note that in this new game, players cannot win via columns or diagonals.\nAlas, these changes did not eliminate ties or the subsequent disagreements. To prevent further disagreements, you\u2019ve decided to analyze the sets of cards to determine if there is any possibility that a tie (where two kids can yell bingo at the same time) can occur. Write a program that takes a collection of bingo cards and determines if there is any possible sequence of numbers that could be called so that the game ends, and a tie between two or more players occurs, when the last number in the sequence is called.\nFor example, consider the following two bingo cards:\n$ \\begin{array}{ccccc} 3 & 29 & 45 & 56 & 68 \\\\ 1 & 19 & 43 & 50 & 72 \\\\ 11 & 25 & 40 & 49 & 61 \\\\ 9 & 23 & 31 & 58 & 63 \\\\ 4 & 27 & 42 & 54 & 71 \\end{array} $\n\u00a0\n$ \\begin{array}{ccccc} 14 & 23 & 39 & 59 & 63 \\\\ 8 & 17 & 35 & 55 & 61 \\\\ 15 & 26 & 42 & 53 & 71 \\\\ 10 & 25 & 31 & 57 & 64 \\\\ 6 & 20 & 44 & 52 & 68 \\\\ \\end{array} $\nThen this set of two cards could result in a tie if the sequence of numbers called was\\[ 40~ 61~ 64~ 10~ 57~ 49~ 11~ 31~ 25 \\]\nThis sequence would result in the card on the left completing the third row and the card on the right completing the fourth row when the number $25$ is called.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input is an integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 100$), the number of bingo cards. After the first line are the $n$ bingo cards, each separated from the next by a blank line of input.\nEach bingo card consists of five lines of input. Each line consists of five integers in the range from $1$ to $3000$. The numbers on each bingo card are unique.\n-----Output-----\nIf no ties are possible between any two cards, output \u201cno ties\u201d. Otherwise, output the two numbers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\le a < b \\le n$) identifying the two cards for which a tie could occur, where the cards are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in the order that they appear in the input. If multiple pairs of cards can tie, output the pair with the smallest $a$, breaking any remaining ties with the smallest $b$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2\n3 29 45 56 68\n1 19 43 50 72\n11 25 40 49 61\n9 23 31 58 63\n4 27 42 54 71\n14 23 39 59 63\n8 17 35 55 61\n15 26 42 53 71\n10 25 31 57 64\n6 20 44 52 68\nSample Output:\n1 2\n\ndef",

Some say that no two cars are alike. Some say that if you look closely, you can see the pale ghosts of miserable humans inside them, trapped forever\u2014particularly in the morning and late afternoon. What scientific eye could frame their fearful symmetry?\nWell, yours, hopefully. As part of your government\u2019s Urban Traffic Control department, you are trying to write a paper on local traffic congestion. It is too dangerous to observe cars in the wild, of course, but you have been given some data on the traffic lights along your town\u2019s Main Street, and you would like to do some theoretical calculations about how well-synchronized they are.\nMain Street is set out on a line, with traffic lights placed at various points along it. Each traffic light cycles between red and green with a fixed period, being red for $r$ seconds, then green for $g$ seconds, then red for $r$ seconds, and so on. The values of $r$ and $g$ may be different for different traffic lights. At time $0$, all the lights have just turned red.\nAssume that an \u201cideal\u201d car mystically appears at the west end of Main Street at a uniformly random real-valued time in the interval $[0, 2019!]$ (where $k!$ is the product of the first $k$ positive integers), driving eastwards at a slow crawl of $1$ meter/second until it hits a red light. What is the probability that it will make it through all the lights without being forced to stop? If it does hit a red light, which one is it likely to hit first?\nWrite a program to answer these questions.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 500$), the number of traffic lights. Each of the following $n$ lines contains three integers $x$, $r$, and $g$ describing a traffic light, where $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^5$) is the position of the light along Main Street in meters, and $r$ and $g$ ($0 \\le r, g$ and $1 \\le r+g \\le 100$) are the durations in seconds of the red and green portions of the light\u2019s period (so the light is red from time $0$ to $r$, from time $r+g$ to $2r+g$, and so on).\nThe west end of Main Street is at position $0$, and the lights are listed in order of strictly increasing position.\n-----Output-----\nFor each of the $n$ lights, output a line containing the probability that this light will be the first red light an \u201cideal\u201d car hits.

Due to his impatience, once Richard is on his bicycle, he does not want to ride any slower than the legal speed limit, stop at intersections, or wait outside Janet\u2019s house (but he does not mind passing by Janet\u2019s house and returning to it later).\nGiven the directed graph representing the neighbourhood around Richard\u2019s and Janet\u2019s houses, Richard wants to devise a route around the neighbourhood (after an optional waiting period at his own house) which minimises the time that Janet has to wait in the worst case. He can travel for as long as he likes and visit each intersection as many times as he likes.\nJanet will call Richard as soon as she is ready, and at that point Richard will take the shortest path to her that he can. Richard does not know exactly when Janet will be ready, but he knows it will be in somewhere between $a$ and $b$ minutes (not necessarily at a whole minute).\nIf Richard is passing through an intersection at the exact same instant Janet calls, the call is considered to happen before he chooses what to do at the intersection. For example, if he is passing by Janet\u2019s house at the moment she calls, he can immediately stop there and she does not have to wait for him at all.\nIt could happen that Janet never has to wait for $w$ minutes, but that she might have to wait for $w - \\epsilon $ minutes for arbitrarily small $\\epsilon > 0$, if she calls Richard at some inopportune moment (say, nanoseconds after he has left an intersection). In this case, we still define the worst case waiting time to be $w$.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line with two integers $a$, $b$ ($0 \\le a \\le b \\le 10^{12}$), indicating that Janet will be ready in at least $a$ minutes and at most $b$ minutes.\n - One line with two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le m \\le 10^5$), the number of intersections and the number of roads in the neighbourhood. The intersections are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n - $m$ lines, each with three integers $u$, $v$ and $t$ ($1 \\le u,v \\le n$, $1 \\le t \\le 10^6$), indicating that there is a one-way road from intersection $u$ to intersection $v$, and that it takes Richard exactly $t$ minutes to travel along this road.\nRichard\u2019s house is at intersection $1$ and Janet\u2019s house is at intersection $n$. It is guaranteed that it is possible to travel from Richard\u2019s house to Janet\u2019s house, and that it is possible to exit each intersection through at least one road, even if that road just loops back to the same intersection.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the time Janet has to wait in the worst case assuming she will be ready in at least $a$ minutes and at most $b$ minutes and Richard plans his route optimally.\nIt can be shown that the worst case waiting time is always an integer.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 20\n3 5\n1 3 7\n2 1 1\n2 3 2\n2 3 5\n3 2 4\nSample Output:\n6\n\ndef",

The board is divided into positions labeled $a, b, c, d, \\dots $ and the players use a gamepiece to mark the current position. Each round of the game consists of two steps:\n - Alice makes a choice. Depending on the current position, she has different options, where each option is a set of positions. Alice chooses one set $S$ among the available sets of positions.\n - Bob makes a choice. His choice is one position $p$ from the set $S$ that Alice chose in step 1. Bob moves the gamepiece to position $p$, which is the position for the start of the next round.\nPrior to the first round, each player independently selects one of the positions and reveals it at the start of the game. Bob\u2019s position is where the game starts. Alice wins the game if she can force Bob to move the gamepiece to the position she has chosen. To make things interesting, they have decided that Bob will pay Alice a certain amount if he loses, but Alice must pay Bob a certain amount after every round. The game now ends if Alice\u2019s position is reached or when Alice runs out of cash.\nBoth Alice and Bob play optimally: Alice will always choose an option that will lead to her winning the game, if this is possible, and Bob will always try to prevent Alice from winning.\nFor all possible start and end positions, Alice would like you to determine whether she can win the game and if so, how many rounds it will take.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line contains the number of positions $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 25$). The $n$ positions are labeled using the first $n$ letters of the English alphabet in lowercase. The rest of the test case consists of $n$ lines, one for each position $p$, in alphabetical order. The line for position $p$ contains the options available to Alice in position $p$. It starts with the number of options $m$ ($1 \\leq m < 2^n$), which is followed by $m$ distinct strings, one for each option. Each string contains the positions available to Bob if Alice chooses that option. The string has at least $1$ character, the characters (which correspond to valid board positions) are in alphabetical order, and no characters are duplicated. The total number of options for the test case is at most $10^6$.\n-----Output-----\nFor each position $p$ in alphabetical order, display one line.

The black boxes are numbered from $1$ to $N$ from left to right. Initially, all black boxes are empty. Then Linux gives Bash $Q$ queries.

If you have, then you are aware that it is an NP-hard problem because it lacks an efficient solution. Well, this task is an uncommon version of the famous problem! Its uncommonness derives from the fact that this version is, actually, solvable.\nThe travelling salesman is on a mission to visit $N$ cities, each exactly once. The cities are represented by numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, N$. What we know is the direct flight duration between each pair of cities. The salesman, being the efficient man that he is, wants to modify the city visiting sequence so that the total flight duration is the minimum possible.\nAlas, all is not so simple. In addition, the salesman has a peculiar condition regarding the sequence. For each city labeled $K$ the following must apply: either all cities with labels smaller than $K$ have been visited before the city labeled $K$ or they will all be visited after the city labeled $K$. In other words, the situation when one of such cities is visited before, and the other after is not allowed.\nAssist the poor fellow in his ambitious mission and calculate the minimum total flight duration needed in order to travel to all the cities, starting from whichever and ending in whichever city, visiting every city exactly once, so that his peculiar request is fulfilled.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the positive integer $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 1500$), the number of cities.

To completely destabilize modern civilization, Tyler Durden and his Project Mayhem trainees are making plans to take down the buildings of major banks that hold everybody\u2019s credit information. If they succeed, then everybody is supposed to restart life with a blank slate, free of all debts ranging from mortgages to student loans.\nTyler plans to do so by setting off pipe bombs under major financial buildings. His crew has mapped out the city\u2019s financial district on a rectangular grid with $R$ rows and $C$ columns. Each grid cell either has a building armed with bombs to detonate (denoted by \u201cx\") or does not (denoted by \u201c.\"). As a friend of Tyler\u2019s, you know all too well that his plan is off the chains. Violence is never the solution.

Naturally, the airplane construction process consists of multiple steps, each of which may take some time. Some steps can take more time to complete than others, e.g. attaching a plane wing may take longer than spray-painting the BAAS logo on the tail. Furthermore, some steps must to be completed before others can commence. For instance the hull needs to be assembled before the wings can be attached to it. If there is no dependency between two steps, then the steps can be completed in parallel.\nBAAS is trying very hard to become the market leader in airplane construction. Since customers value a speedy delivery, BAAS has decided to invest in their R&D department with the goal to decrease their delivery time. The chief scientist of BAAS is very optimistic and thinks that his department can reduce the time it takes to complete one step to $0$. However, since the money is always tight in the research sector at BAAS, he could only promise to eliminate exactly one of the construction steps. As the CEO of BAAS, your role implies figuring out which step you would like to eliminate to achieve the shortest possible construction time. It goes without saying that as the CEO you have complete access to the BAAS\u2019s secret construction process blueprints.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $N$ ($2 \\le N \\le 400$), the number of steps in the build process.\nThe next line contains the $N$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_ N$ ($1 \\le a_ i \\le 10^5$), the number of seconds each of the $N$ steps takes in the build process.\nThis is followed by $N$ lines.

The reason is that, as a middle school teacher, he has been asked to dedicate the entire week to teaching his class of $n$ students about the cause and effect of global warming. As John is very passionate about his planet, he\u2019s going to spend extra time and effort to make this week memorable and rewarding for the students. Towards that, one of the things he wants to ask them to do is to prepare, as homework, presentations about global warming. To make this a little easier for them, as well as more fun, he has asked them to do this in groups of two.\nOf course arranging the students into groups comes with the usual headache, namely that only friends are willing to work together. Luckily the students in his class are a friendly bunch. In particular, if $p$, $q$ and $r$ are three distinct students, and $p$ and $q$ are friends, and $q$ and $r$ are friends, then $p$ and $r$ are also friends. But John now realizes the irony in asking his students to work at home in groups, as students may have to travel to meet their group partner, which may emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, depending on their mode of transportation. In the spirit of this week\u2019s topic, John asked all the students in his class to calculate, for each of their friends, how much carbon dioxide would be emitted if they were to meet up with the respective friend.\nUsing this information, can you help John figure out what is the minimum total amount of carbon dioxide that will be emitted if he arranges the groups optimally, or determine that it\u2019s not possible to arrange all the students into groups of two friends?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 200$, $0 \\leq m \\leq 250$), the number of students in John\u2019s class, and the total number of pairs of friends in the class.

Various anti-aging pills get introduced to the market at various times which allow a person to age more slowly than normal. In particular, an $x$-$y$ pill, when taken regularly, ages your body only $y$ seconds over the course of $x$ seconds. So, if you took a $100$-$87$ pill regularly, then over the next $100$ seconds, your body would only age $87$ seconds. You can only take one of these pills at a time (or none at all). The only downside to using one of these pills is that due to the change in regimen, if you switch to a pill, it automatically ages you $c$ seconds. The value of $c$ is the same for all pills.\nAny time you switch to an $x$-$y$ pill, you can take it for any number of seconds, but you can only switch to a pill at or after the time it first becomes available on the market. For the purposes of this problem assume that your life starts at time $t = 0$ seconds and that without the aid of any pills, you would live to be $n$ seconds old.\nGiven information about each different pill introduced into the market (the time it is introduced, in seconds, and its corresponding $x$ and $y$ values as previously described) and $c$, the number of seconds you automatically age when switching pills (or switching to a pill from no pill at all), determine the longest you can live, over all possible schedule of pills you could take.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of three positive integers, $n$ ($n \\le 3\\cdot 10^9$), representing the number of seconds you would live without taking any pills, $p$ ($p \\le 10^5$), the number of pills that become available on the market, and $c$ ($c \\le 10^5$), the time in seconds you age as soon as you switch to a different pill. $p$ lines follow with the $i^{th}$ line containing three space separated integers: $t_{i}$ $(1 \\le t_{i} \\le 10^{12})$, $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$ $(1 \\le y_{i} < x_{i} \\le 10^{4}$), representing the time the $i^{th}$ pill gets introduced to the market, and the corresponding $x$ and $y$ values for it.

Surprisingly, it does not matter how much power each chip gets, but a machine works best when its two chips have power outputs as close as possible. The power output of a chip is simply the smallest power output of its $k$ batteries.\nYou have a stockpile of $2nk$ batteries that you want to assign to the chips.

Each badge is assigned an ID number, and the idea was that electronic locks on each door should allow access only to personnel whose ID number indicated that they had appropriate security clearance to enter that room, hallway, closet, or whatever lay on the other side of the door. \nThe contract for the lock system, however, was put out to the lowest bidder, who clearly misunderstood the intention. Instead of each lock storing a list of permitted ID numbers, instead each lock stores exactly two numbers, a lower and upper bound, and permits passage to badges whose number lies between those bounds. For example, a lock keyed as $(25, 29)$ would pass only badges $25, 26, 27, 28,$ and $29$.\nComplicating the matter is the fact that lock on each side of the door can be keyed differently, so a person who is able to pass through the door in one direction might not be able to return once the door has closed behind them.\nThe results have been frustrating (and occasionally entertaining \u2013 videos of everyone in the company trying to find a way to the cafeteria at noon have gone viral on social media).\nIt has become a major task, when hiring or promoting any employee, to find a badge number that will actually get them from the front door to their new office.\nWrite a program to determine how many badge numbers will permit passage from one given room to another.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input will contain integers $N$, $L$, and $B$, denoting the number of rooms, of locks, and of badge numbers, respectively. $2 \\leq N \\leq 1000$, $1 \\leq L \\leq 5000$, $1 \\leq B \\leq 10^9$\nThe next line of input will contain two integers, $S$ and $D$, $1 \\leq S \\leq N$, $1 \\leq D \\leq N$, $S \\neq D$, denoting the starting and destination rooms that we are interested in.\nThis is followed by $L$ lines, each describing a lock as four integers:\\[ a \\; b \\; x \\; y \\]\nindicating that a lock permits passage from room $a$ to room $b$ (but not from $b$ to $a$) for badges numbered from $x$ to $y$, inclusive.

Therefore she has decided to play the composition in the following way:\n - before playing, she will choose one non-negative integer $K$\n - in the beginning, she will play the correct multi-key (her multi-teacher told her which multi-key that is)\n - when she hears that the multi-key played in the multi-composition is higher than the previous multi-key played in the multi-composition, she will play the multi-key denoted with the integer larger than the multi-key she played previously by $K$\n - analogously, when she hears that the multi-key played in the multi-composition is lower than the previous multi-key played in the multi-composition, she will play the multi-key denoted with the integer smaller than the multi-key she played previously by $K$\n - when she hears that the multi-key played in the multi-composition is equal to the previous multi-key played in the multi-composition, she will repeat the multi-key she played previously\nNotice that, when Mirka is playing, she does not compare the pitch of the keys she played to the pitch of the keys from the composition.\nHelp Mirka choose the integer $K$ in order to hit as many correct pitches as possible.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$), the number of multi-keys in the multi- composition on the multi-radio.\nThe second line of input contains $N$ integers $a_ i$ ($-10^9 \\leq a_ i \\leq 10^9$), the multi-keys played in the multi-composition.\n-----Output-----\nThe first line of output must contain the maximum number of multi-keys that Mirka can play correctly.

Each frog $i$ is described by three parameters $(l_ i,w_ i,h_ i)$ where $l_ i$ is its leap capacity, $w_ i$ its weight, and $h_ i$ its height. The leap capacity specifies how high that frog can jump. If a frog\u2019s leap capacity is strictly larger than the depth of the pit, the frog can directly escape the pit. However, these frogs are altruistic. Rather than selfishly saving themselves and leaving the frogs with too limited leap capacity behind, they collectively aim to save as many of them from the pit as possible. \nThe frogs realize that if a frog $A$ climbs up on the back of frog $B$ before it jumps, the first frog $A$ stands a better chance of escaping the pit: it can escape if $h_ B+l_ A$ is strictly larger than the depth of the pit.\nFurthermore, if frog $B$ carrying frog $A$ on its back climbs up on the back of frog $C$, the situation is even better for frog $A$: it can now escape the pit if $h_ C+h_ B+l_ A$ is strictly larger than the depth of the pit.\nThe frogs can build even higher piles of frogs this way, the only restriction is that no frog may carry other frogs of weight in total amounting to its own weight or heavier. Once a pile has been used to allow a frog to escape, the frogs in the pile jump back to the bottom of the pit and they can then form a new pile (possibly consisting of a different set of frogs).

Autocorrect not only fixes common typos, but also suggests how to finish the word while you type it. Jenny has recently been pondering how she can use this feature to her advantage, so that she can send a particular message with the minimum amount of typing. \nThe autocorrect feature on Jenny\u2019s phone works like this: the phone has an internal dictionary of words sorted by their frequency in the English language. Whenever a word is being typed, autocorrect suggests the most common word (if any) starting with all the letters typed so far. By pressing tab, the word being typed is completed with the autocorrect suggestion. Autocorrect can only be used after the first character of a word has been typed \u2013 it is not possible to press tab before having typed anything. If no dictionary word starts with the letters typed so far, pressing tab has no effect.\nJenny has recently noticed that it is sometimes possible to use autocorrect to her advantage even when it is not suggesting the correct word, by deleting the end of the autocorrected word. For instance, to type the word \u201cautocorrelation\u201d, Jenny starts typing \u201caut\u201d, which then autocorrects to \u201cautocorrect\u201d (because it is such a common word these days!) when pressing tab. By deleting the last two characters (\u201cct\u201d) and then typing the six letters \u201clation\u201d, the whole word can be typed using only $3$ (\u201caut\u201d) ${}+1$ (tab) ${}+2$ (backspace twice) ${}+6$ (\u201clation\u201d) $= 12$ keystrokes, $3$ fewer than typing \u201cautocorrelation\u201d without using autocorrect.\nGiven the dictionary on the phone and the words Jenny wants to type, output the minimum number of keystrokes required to type each word. The only keys Jenny can use are the letter keys, tab and backspace.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two positive integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$), the number of words in the dictionary, and $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 10^5$), the number of words to type. Then follow $n$ lines with one word per line, sorted in decreasing order of how common the word is (the first word is the most common). No word appears twice in the dictionary. Then follow $m$ lines, containing the words to type.\nThe dictionary and the words to type only use lower case letters \u2018a\u2019-\u2018z\u2019. The total size of the input file is at most $1$ MB.\n-----Output-----\nFor each word to type, output a line containing the minimum number of keystrokes required to type the corresponding word.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 5\naustria\nautocorrect\nprogram\nprogramming\ncomputer\nautocorrelation\nprogramming\ncompetition\nzyx\naustria\nSample Output:\n12\n4\n11\n3\n2\n\ndef",

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Anatoly Cheng McDougal is a typical student in many ways. Whenever possible he tries to cut and paste code instead of writing it from scratch. Unavoidably this approach causes him problems. For example, when he first learned about preorder, inorder and postorder traversals of trees, and was given code for a preorder print of a tree (shown on the left below), he simply cut and pasted the code, then moved the print statement to the correct location and renamed the procedure. However, he forgot to rename the procedure calls inside the code, resulting in the defective inorder print and postorder print code shown below.\nvoid prePrint(TNode t)\n{     \n  output(t.value);\n  if (t.left!= null) prePrint(t.left);\n  if (t.right!= null)  prePrint(t.right);\n}\nvoid inPrint(TNode t)\n{\n  if (t.left!= null) prePrint(t.left);\n  output(t.value);\n  if (t.right!= null) prePrint(t.right);\n}\nvoid postPrint(TNode t)\n{\n  if (t.left!= null) prePrint(t.left);\n  if (t.right!= null) prePrint(t.right);\n  output(t.value);\n}\nAt this point, Anatoly did not behave like a typical student. He actually tested his code! Unfortunately, when the results were not correct, he reverted back to typical student behavior. He panicked and started randomly changing calls in all three procedures, hoping to get things right. Needless to say, the situation became even worse now than when he started.\nAnatoly\u2019s professor tested the code on a random tree of characters. When she looked at the output of his three print routines, she correctly guessed what had happened. However, instead of going directly to his code, she decided to try to reconstruct Anatoly\u2019s code just by observing the output. In order to do this, she correctly made the following assumptions:\n - The output statement in each print routine is in the correct location (for example, between the two recursive calls in the inPrint routine).\n - Among the six recursive calls made by the three routines, exactly two calls are to prePrint, exactly two are to inPrint, and exactly two are to postPrint, though potentially in the wrong routines.\nSoon the professor realized that reconstructing Anatoly\u2019s code and the test tree from his output was not a simple task and that the result might be ambiguous. You will have to help her find all possible reconstructions of Anatoly\u2019s code. In addition, for each such reconstruction, you are to find the alphabetically first tree (as described in the output section) giving the observed output.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of three strings on three separate lines: the observed output of Anatoly\u2019s prePrint, inPrint and postPrint routines (in that order) on some test tree. Each of these strings consists of $n$ uppercase letters ($4 \\le n \\le 26$), with no repeated letters in any string. The test case is guaranteed to have at least one solution.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay all possible reconstructions for the test case, ordered as described in the last paragraph below. The output for each reconstruction consists of two parts. The first part is a single line and describes the six calls in Anatoly\u2019s routines: first the two (recursive) calls in Anatoly\u2019s prePrint routine, followed by the calls in his inPrint routine, and finally the calls in his postPrint routine. The calls are described by the words Pre, In, and Post, separated by spaces. For example, if Anatoly\u2019s routines were correct, the resulting output of the first part of the reconstruction would be Pre Pre In In Post Post.\nThe second part consists of three lines and describes the first test tree that could have generated the observed outputs. The first line is the correct preorder print of the tree, and the second and third lines contain the correct inorder and postorder prints, respectively. The first tree is the one with the alphabetically first preorder print. If there are multiple such trees, the first of these is the one with the alphabetically first inorder print.\nEvery reconstruction is a sequence of 6 tokens chosen from Pre, In, and Post. The ordering of reconstructions is lexicographic with respect to the following ordering of tokens: Pre < In < Post.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nHFBIGEDCJA\nBIGEDCJFAH\nBIGEDCJFAH\nSample Output:\nPre Post In Post In Pre\nHFBJCDEGIA\nBIGEDCJFAH\nIGEDCJBAFH\n\ndef",

Hasse\u2019s radar station (which does not work quite like other radar stations) emits continuous signals of three different wave-lengths. Therefore, the only interesting thing you can measure is the phase of a signal as it reaches you. For example, if the signal you tuned on to has a wave-length of $100$ meters and you are $1456$ meters from the station, your equipment can only tell you that you are either $56$, or $156$, or $256$, or $\\dots $ meters away from the lighthouse.\nSo you reach for your last piece of paper to start calculating \u2013 but wait, there\u2019s a catch!

In NenScript, a variable always stores a string of zero or more characters, each character is any of the following: lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, space and special characters: [email\u00a0protected]#$%^&*()-_=+. In this problem, we call these characters good characters. The name of every variable only consists of lowercase English letters, and underscore (_). The length of a variable name is between $1$ and $10$, inclusive.\nIn order to use a variable, first we need to declare it. The syntax of the declaration is as below:\nvar <name> = <value>;\nHere <name> is the name of the variable you want to declare, and <value> is an expression which denotes the string assigned to this variable. There are $3$ types of expression in NenScript:\n - Variable name, which means that the value equals to some previously declared variable.\n - String literal, which explicitly states the value by putting its sequence of characters in quotes.\n - Template literal, which allows you to create a string based on values of other variables by embedding expressions.\nIn a template literal, embedded expressions are calculated, then concatented with other parts to create a string. Template literals are enclosed by back-tick (`) and contain several (possibly zero) string expressions. String expressions are put inside curly braces following a dollar sign (${expression}). In other words, a template literal is an expression of the form `$S_1\\$ \\{ E_1\\} S_2\\$ \\{ E_2\\} \\ldots S_ n\\$ \\{ E_ n\\} S_{n+1}$`, where $n \\ge 0$. For every valid $i$, $S_ i$ is a string consisting of zero or more good characters, and $E_ i$ is an expression.\nLet\u2019s take an example:\nvar a = \"Gon\";\nvar b = a;\nvar c = `My name is ${a}`;\nHere, the values of a, b and c are \u201cGon\u201d, \u201cGon\u201d and \u201cMy name is Gon\u201d, respectively. Note that quotes are for clarity only, no vairable\u2019s value contains any quotes.\nTemplate literals can be nested, in other words, there can be a template literal inside a template literal. For example:\nvar a = \"Gon\";\nvar b = `My name ${`is ${a}`}`;\nIn this example, \u201c \u2018is ${a}\u2018 \u201d, whose value is \u201cis Gon\u201d, acts as an embedded expression of the template literal assigned to variable b. The value of b is \u201cMy name is Gon\u201d.\nYour task is to read a sequence of commands in NenScript, each of them is either a variable declaration, as explained above; or a print request, which is in the following form, where <expr> is an expression:\nprint <expr>;\nFor each print request, print the value of the given expression.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of several lines, each is either a variable declaration or a print request, as explained above. It is guaranteed all variables are neither declared twice, nor used before being declared. The input is terminated by a line with exactly one word \u201cend.\u201d.

Each turn, your gnomes will attack the enemy, causing one unit of damage for each living gnome. Then the enemy will attack by throwing a lightning bolt at one of the $m$ groups. The lightning bolt kills $k$ of the gnomes in that group, or all of them if the number of living gnomes in the group is less than $k$. The battle ends when all gnomes are dead. The enemy will always throw the lightning bolts in an optimal way such that the total damage caused by the gnomes is minimized.\nNow you wonder, what is the maximum amount of damage you can cause to the enemy if you divide the gnomes into groups in an optimal way?\nFor example, if as in Sample Input 1 you have $n=10$ gnomes that are to be divided into $m=4$ groups, and the lightning bolt does at most $k=3$ damage, then an optimal solution would be to create one large group of size $7$ and three small groups of size $1$. In the first round, you cause $10$ damage and the lightning bolt reduces the large group by $3$. In the next round, you cause $7$ damage and the large group is reduced down to size $1$. In the remaining four rounds you do $4$, $3$, $2$, and $1$ damage respectively and the lightning bolt removes one group each round. In total you do $10+7+4+3+2+1 = 27$ damage.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing the three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le m, k \\le 10^7$), with meanings as described above.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the maximum amount of damage you can cause to the enemy.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 4 3\nSample Output:\n27\n\ndef",

However, her family lived on the other side of the forest. Our dear monkey wants to suprise them and bring them as much banana smoothie as possible. \nUnfortunately, having three heads consumes a lot of energy, so the monkey drinks one millilitre (ml) of smoothie per meter she walks. Note that this is completely continuous, so for example after walking $\\frac{\\sqrt {2} + \\pi }{3}$ meters she has consumed $\\frac{\\sqrt {2} + \\pi }{3}$ ml of smoothie. If she is not carrying any smoothie, she can not move. Furthermore, despite going to the gym every day, the monkey has limited strength and is only able to carry a limited amount of smoothie at a time. Thus she may not be able to bring all the smoothie with her at once.\nWhat she can do however is to leave containers of smoothie anywhere she wants in the forest and then pick them up again later. That way she can for instance move some of the smoothie part of the way, go back to pick up more smoothie, and so on. The monkey starts with all the smoothie in a single place and a (for her purposes) unlimited supply of large containers (large enough so that each of them has room for more smoothie than the monkey can carry). As the monkey only has two hands (despite her large number of heads), she can only carry at most two containers at the same time. The containers are essentially weightless, so the monkey can carry the same amount of smoothie regardless of whether she is carrying one or two containers. They are also bio-degradable, so she can leave empty containers anywhere she likes in the forest without staining her conscience.\nHow much smoothie (in ml) can she bring to her family on the other side of the forest? The family members are lazy and will not help the monkey transport the smoothie. The monkey does not have to deliver all the smoothie to her family at the same time.\nYou may make the following somewhat unrealistic (in the sense that no smoothie-transporting monkeys we have ever seen have satisfied them) assumptions:\n - The monkey is able to exactly transfer any real number of ml of smoothie between two containers she is carrying. Similarly, she is able to exactly walk any real number of meters.\n - Any number of containers can occupy the exact same position (they do so at the start, and during the transport the monkey is able to leave several containers in exactly the same spot).\n - Only walking consumes energy: picking up or dropping off a container, turning around, or just standing still, does not consume energy.\n-----Input-----\nThe only line of the input contains three integers $D, W, C$ \u2013 the distance between the monkey and her family in meters, the total amount of smoothie in ml and finally her maximum carrying capacity in ml. All integers are positive and at most $1000000$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line with one number, the amount of smoothie in ml that the Three-Headed Monkey is able to bring to her family. Output will be considered correct if it is within relative or absolute error $10^{-7}$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1000 3000 1000\nSample Output:\n533.3333333333\n\ndef",

Spread around the park are various squeaky toys and other dog paraphernalia, which Spot happily goes after when he sees them. When he gets to a toy he will chew at it for a while until it has become defunct, at which point he will go after the next toy, which looks much squeakier.\nThis is all very well, but there are obstacles to Spot\u2019s joyful canine play: trees. In the park there are several trees, and if Spot walks around a tree his leash gets wrapped around the tree, making his movements more limited. Being a dog, with pressing squeaky matters to attend to, Spot does not really have time to take things such as trees into account, and always goes directly in a straight line for his next toy.

However, when both players opt for the same strategy, the result can often become... quick, brutal and messy. Sadly, the game only allows for up to $400$ Zerglings per player. In this problem, however, you will simulate games that could have more than $400$ Zerglings.\nThe map on which Zerg rushes occur is represented by a $N \\times N$ grid. Each Zergling occupies a grid square and no two Zerglings ever occupy the same grid square. Each Zergling has a certain number of hit points which starts off as $35$. Its attack value is $5$ plus the attack upgrade of the player that controls it. When one Zergling attacks another, the damage incurred equals to the attack value of the attacking Zergling minus the armour upgrade of the player that owns the Zergling being attacked. The number of hit points of the Zergling that is attacked is reduced by the amount of the damage.\nDue to the inability of both players to manage their huge horde of Zerglings, the Zerglings make their decisions each turn using the following algorithm (Zerglings are not the brightest creatures, as you will see):\n - If there is an opponent Zergling in one of the $8$ horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent grid squares, the Zergling will attack it. A Zergling attacks at most one opponent each turn; see below for the tie-breaking rules.\n - Otherwise, if the other player has at least one Zergling remaining on the map, the Zergling will move to the horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent square that is closest to the opponent\u2019s closest Zergling in terms of Manhattan distance. When more than one adjacent square is closest, the tie-breaking rules below are used. The Manhattan distance between two points is the sum of the differences in the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the points.\nWhen the above rules could cause the Zergling to attack in more than one direction, or to move in more than one direction, the following tie-breaking rule is used. The Zergling will prefer the first direction starting with north going clockwise. That is, the directions in order of preference are north, northeast, east, southeast, etc.\nOnce all Zerglings have made their decisions, all the attacks are conducted simultaneously and all the Zerglings with $0$ or fewer hit points are marked as dead and removed from the map. Then all the movements of the Zerglings that didn\u2019t attack are conducted simultaneously. If the square to which a Zergling is moving is occupied by another Zergling that is not moving away in this turn, then the Zergling does not move. If two or more Zerglings try to move to the same grid square, then the Zergling in the northernmost row has the right of way and the other Zergling remains stationary. If there are multiple Zerglings in the northernmost row trying to move to the same grid square, then of these, the westernmost Zergling moves and the others remain stationary. Zerglings also have a remarkable regeneration rate. After each turn, all the Zerglings that are still alive and have less than $35$ hitpoints will regain one hit point.\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with $N$ between $2$ and $150$, followed by $2$ pairs of $2$ integers between $0$ and $3$, the attack and armour upgrades of the first player, followed by the attack and armour upgrades of the second player.

For each subject $i$, the expected grade with $t$ hours of studying is given by the function $f_ i(t) = a_ i t^2 + b_ i t + c_ i$, satisfying the following properties:\n - $f_ i(0) \\geq 0$;\n - $f_ i(T) \\leq 100$;\n - $a_ i < 0$;\n - $f_ i(t)$ is a non-decreasing function in the interval $[0,T]$.\nYou may allocate any fraction of an hour to a subject, not just whole hours. What is the maximum average grade you can obtain over all $n$ subjects?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of each input contains the integers $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\le 10$) and $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\le 240$) separated by a space. This is followed by $N$ lines, each containing the three parameters $a_ i$, $b_ i$, and $c_ i$ describing the function $f_ i(t)$. The three parameters are separated by a space, and are given as real numbers with $4$ decimal places. Their absolute values are no more than $100$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput in a single line the maximum average grade you can obtain.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Ticket to Ride1 is a board game for up to $5$ players. The goal of the game is to set up train lines (and to thwart the opponents\u2019 attempts at setting up their train lines). At the beginning of play, each player is assigned four train lines. A player may choose to discard as many of these four assignments as she likes. Each assignment has a score, corresponding to its difficulty (so, typically, a train line between e.g.\u00a0Stockholm and Tokyo would be worth more than a train line between e.g.\u00a0Stockholm and Utrecht). At the end of the game, each player gets points for the assignments that they have successfully completed, and penalty points for the assignments that they have failed to complete. \nAn assignment consists of a pair of cities that are to be connected by a series of shorter railway routes. A route can be claimed (for a certain cost associated with the route), but things are complicated by the fact that there is only a limited number of routes, and once a player claims a route, none of the other players can claim it. A player has successfully set up a train line between two cities if there is a path between the two cities using only routes that have been claimed by this player. For simplicity, we will ignore all additional aspects of the game (including the actual process of claiming routes and additional ways to score points).\nFor instance, if your assignment is to connect Stockholm and Amsterdam in the Figure above, you would probably want to claim the routes between Stockholm and Copenhagen, and between Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But if another player manages to claim the route between Copenhagen and Stockholm before you, your train line would have to use some other routes, e.g.\u00a0by going to Copenhagen via Oslo.\nIn this problem, we will consider the rather bold strategy of trying to complete all four assignments (typically, this will be quite hard). As a preliminary assessment of the difficulty of achieving this, we would like to calculate the minimum cost of setting up all four lines assuming that none of the other players interfere with our plans. Your job is to write a program to determine this minimum cost.\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with two integers $1 \\le n \\le 40$, $0 \\le m \\le 1000$, giving the number of cities and railway routes in the map, respectively. Then follow $n$ lines, giving the names of the $n$ cities. City names are at most $20$ characters long and consist solely of lower case letters (\u2019a\u2019-\u2019z\u2019).\nAfter this follow $m$ lines, each containing the names of two different cities and an integer $1 \\le c \\le 10000$, indicating that there is a railway route with cost $c$ between the two cities. Note that there may be several railway routes between the same pair of cities. You may assume that it is always possible to set up a train line from any city to any other city.\nFinally, there are four lines, each containing the names of two cities, giving the four train line assignments.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line containing a single integer, the minimum possible cost to set up all four train lines.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 15\nstockholm\namsterdam\nlondon\nberlin\ncopenhagen\noslo\nhelsinki\ndublin\nreykjavik\nbrussels\noslo stockholm 415\nstockholm helsinki 396\noslo london 1153\noslo copenhagen 485\nstockholm copenhagen 522\ncopenhagen berlin 354\ncopenhagen amsterdam 622\nhelsinki berlin 1107\nlondon amsterdam 356\nberlin amsterdam 575\nlondon dublin 463\nreykjavik dublin 1498\nreykjavik oslo 1748\nlondon brussels 318\nbrussels amsterdam 173\nstockholm amsterdam\noslo london\nreykjavik dublin\nbrussels helsinki\nSample Output:\n3907\n\ndef",

Note that these events are now considered to not have happened, so they should not be counted when processing subsequent D lines.\n - A scenario line is of the form \u201cS $k$ $e_1$ $\\ldots $ $e_ k$\u201d, where $1 \\le k \\le 30$ is an integer giving the number of events and $e_1, \\ldots, e_ k$ is the list of events of the scenario. In a scenario, each event may be prefixed with a \u2018!\u2019, indicating that the event did not happen in this scenario.\nEvents are strings containing at most $20$ characters and using only the characters \u2018a\u2019-\u2018z\u2019 and underscores (\u2018_\u2019). For \u2018D\u2019 lines, you can assume that $r$ is an integer between $1$ and $R$, where $R$ is the total number of events that have happened so far (and that have not turned out to be a dream). For \u2018E\u2019 lines, you can assume that $e$ is not an event that has already happened, except if the previous occurence of the event turned out to be a dream, in which case it can happen again.Warning\nThis problem has somewhat large amounts of input and output. We recommend you to make sure that your input and output are properly buffered in order to make the most of the few seconds of execution time that we give you.\n-----Output-----\nFor each scenario in the input, output a line as follows:\n - \u201cYes\u201d if the given scenario is consistent with what has happened so far.\n - \u201c$r$ Just A Dream\u201d if the given scenario would be consistent with what has happened so far, provided a \u201cD $r$\u201d line had occurred just before the scenario.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:When the first scrollbars appeared on resizable windows during user interface development in the Elder Days, computer graphics were still primitive. Widgets were made with ASCII symbols and text was monospaced. A window displayed a viewport: a part of a much longer text, adjusted to fit the width of the window. The thumb, shown as an X, represented the position of the viewport relative to the full (adjusted) text and allowed vertical nagivation by clicking and dragging.\nAlas, much of the knowledge of the Ancients has been lost in the Great Purge of the Second Iconoclast Uprising, which destroyed the last remaining implementations of the user interface layer of the Elder GUI. As head programmer of the National Laboratory of Interaction Design Archeology it is your job to recreate the behaviour of the machines of yore as faithfully as possible.\nThanks to many years of studies, you have full understanding of the typographical aesthetics of the Elder Days: Lines were set flush left but ragged-right, and words on the same line were separated by single spaces. Line breaking was simple in those days: When the next word of the text fit on the current line, it was put there, otherwise a new line was started. If a word was too wide to fit the viewport, it was set on a line of its own and truncated at the right margin.\nThe language of the Ancients was written in upper- and lowercase letters of the English alphabet without punctuation or hyphenation. The scroll bar on the right contained navigation widgets for \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d at the top and bottom.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line consists of $4$ integers $W$, $H$, $F$, $N$, separated by single spaces. The width of the viewport is $W$, with $3\\leq W\\leq 200$. The height of the viewport is $H$, with $3\\leq H\\leq 200$. The viewport must show line $F$ of the adjusted input as the first line at the top line; lines are numbered $0,\\ldots, L-1$, where $L$ is the total number of lines in the adjusted text; you can assume $0\\leq F \\leq L - H$ and $H < L$. The following $N$ lines for $1\\leq N\\leq 30000$ contain the text (not adjusted), between $1$ and $80$\u00a0characters per line, including spaces; neither the first nor last character in each line are a space. No word in the language of the Ancients was more than $80$\u00a0characters.\n-----Thumb position-----\nYou have discovered many ancient texts explaining the position $T\\in \\{ 0,\\ldots, H-3\\} $ of the thumb. Alas, all are written in arcane languages that are long forgotten. One example reads like this:\nSUBTRACT H FROM L GIVING DENOMINATOR.\nSUBTRACT 3 FROM H.\nMULTIPLY F BY H GIVING NUMERATOR.\nDIVIDE NUMERATOR BY DENOMINATOR GIVING T REMAINDER Left-Over.\nAnother source claims that $T$ can be determined by an incantation that is almost poetic in its mystery,\n H 3 - F *  L H - /\nand yet another obscure author writes\n(defun thumb (lines height first) (/ (* (- height 3) first) (- lines height)))\n-----Output-----\nPrint the window as the Ancients would have seen it, built from minus (-), plus (+), pipe (|), lower-case V (v), caret (^), and upper-case X (X).

She enjoys it a lot, but it seems that, throughout the years, she has reviewed all the restaurants on Earth. It\u2019s now time to move one level up; she is going to review the food served by the airlines, so that the readers can make better decisions on which flights to take.\nHer boss gave her a list of flight connections that she needs to review for the upcoming issue of Cosmopolitan. She knows that they serve the same food in both directions of every flight, so she only needs to take it once. She realized that she will need to take some additional flights, because she can not make all reviews using only flights in the list from her boss. Therefore she did some quick research and made a list of additional flights which she might take. She will not review the food on these flights; they will only be used so that she can make all the reviews.\nFrida\u2019s goal is to make all the reviews while spending the least money on flight tickets. Her office is in Stockholm, so she starts and ends her journey there. Each flight is both ways between two cities and has a fixed price in both directions. You can assume that it is possible to make all the reviews using some of the additional flights.\nFor the purposes of this problem we ignore the price Frida has to pay for accommodation and we also ignore the departure and arrival times of flights by assuming that every flight is very often and reasonably short. We only focus on the total price of the flights.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains $2$ space separated integers $N, R, (2\\leq N\\leq 15, 0\\leq R\\leq 105)$, where $N$ is the number of airports mentioned in the input and $R$ is the number of flights to review.

Each line contains 3 space separated integers $a, b, c, (1\\leq a, b\\leq N, 1\\leq c\\leq 10000)$, where $a, b$ denote 2 distinct airports and $c$ is the cost of the flight in Swedish kronor in both directions. No pair of $2$ cities is listed twice.\nThe next line contains an integer $F$, $(0\\leq F\\leq 250)$, the number of additional flights available. The next $F$ lines contain descriptions of flights in the same format as above. There may be more flights between a pair of cities.

One simple measure is the mean value: the sum of all values divided by the number of values. Another is the median: the middle among all values when they have been sorted. If there are an even number of values, the mean of the two middle values will form the median.\nThese kinds of measures can be used for example to describe the population in a country or even some parts of the population in the country. Anne Jensen, Maria Virtanen, Jan Hansen, Erik Johansson and J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3rsson want to find a statistical measurement of how many statisticians there are in the Nordic countries. To be more precise, they want to find out how many statisticians there are per unit area. As the population in the Nordic countries are well spread out they will try the new measurement MAD, Median of All Densities. First put a square grid on the map. Then draw a rectangle aligned with the grid and calculate the density of statisticians in that area, i.e. the mean number of statisticians per area unit. After that, repeat the procedure until all possible rectangles have been covered. Finally the MAD is the median of all statistician densities.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains of two space separated numbers $h$ and $w$ describing the height and width of the square grid, where $1 \\leq h \\leq 140$ and $1 \\leq w \\leq 120$. The next line contains two space separated numbers $a$ and $b$ which are the lower and upper bound of the allowed rectangle areas, i.e. $1 \\leq a \\leq rectangle area \\leq b \\leq w \\times h$. Then there will follow $h$ lines with $w$ space separated numbers $s$ describing the number of statisticians in each square of the map, $0 \\leq s \\leq 10000$. There will always exist a rectangle with an area in $[a,b]$.\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains of one line with the MAD.

In fact, most arcade games these days seem to depend entirely on luck. Consider the arcade game shown in the picture, which consists of different holes arranged in a triangular shape. A ball is dropped near the hole at the top. The ball either falls into the hole, in which case the game ends, or it bounces to one of its (up to) $4$ neighbors, denoted by the red arrows. Different holes have different payouts \u2014 some may even be negative! If the ball reaches another hole, the process repeats: the ball either falls into the hole, ending the game \u2014 or it bounces to one of its neighbors, possibly ad infinitum! \nWrite a program that computes the expected payout when dropping a ball into the machine!\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 32$) describing the number of rows of the arcade machine. The second line contains $H = N (N+1) / 2$ integers $v_ i$ ($-100 \\le v_ i \\le 100$) describing the payout (positive or negative) if the ball drops into hole $i$. Holes are numbered such that hole $1$ is in the first row, holes $2$ and $3$ are in the second row, etc. The $k^{\\textrm{th}}$ row starts with hole number $k (k-1) / 2 + 1$ and contains exactly $k$ holes.\nThese two lines are followed by $H$ lines, each of which contains $5$ real numbers $p_0 \\ p_1 \\ p_2 \\ p_3 \\ p_4$, denoting the probability that the ball bounces to its top-left ($p_0$), top-right ($p_1$), bottom-left ($p_2$), or bottom-right ($p_3$) neighbors or that the ball enters the hole ($p_4$). Each probability is given with at most $3$ decimal digits after the period. It is guaranteed that $0.0 \\le p_ i \\le 1.0$ and $\\sum p_ i = 1.0$. If a hole does not have certain neighbors because it is located near the boundary of the arcade machine, the probability of bouncing to these non-existent neighbors is always zero. For instance, for hole number $1$, the probabilities to jump to the top-left and top-right neighbors are both given as $0.0$.\nYou can assume that after the ball has bounced $b$ times, the probability that it has not fallen into a hole is at most $(1 - 10^{-3})^{\\lfloor b/H \\rfloor }$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single number, the expected value from playing one game.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:At the new start-up company Gaggle, we have rejected the oppressive corporate structures of old, with all of their managers and subordinates and hierarchies and so on. Instead we have embraced a free and open corporate culture in which all employees (called Gagglers) are in charge of themselves and allowed to roam free. \nRather than having managers overseeing the work, the main method used to coordinate work at Gaggle is a mentor system: each Gaggler designates some other Gaggler as their mentor, with whom they discuss their ongoing projects. This mentor relation may or may not be symmetric (in other words you may or may not be the mentor of your mentor) but you can never be the mentor of yourself.\nInitially, all Gagglers were able to pick anyone they liked as their mentor, but after a while it was discovered that this lead to two problems:\n - Some people were more popular than others and had too many choosing them as their mentor, causing them not to have time to do their actual work.\n - Some flocks of Gagglers ended up isolated from the rest of the company (e.g.,\u00a0if Gagglers $A$ and $B$ are each other\u2019s mentors and they are not the mentor of anyone else), causing failure of these flocks to coordinate with the rest of the company.\nIn order to remedy these two flaws, it was (collectively) decided that:\n - Every Gaggler must be the mentor of exactly one other Gaggler, and\n - Assuming every Gaggler only communicates with their mentor and their mentee, it must still be possible for any information that any Gaggler has to reach any other Gaggler.\nIn order to reward lower-numbered (more senior) Gagglers while introducing this new policy, it was decided that lower-numbered Gagglers should get to keep their current mentor if possible, and if they have to change, their new mentor should be as low-numbered (more senior, and therefore more experienced) as possible.\nConcretely, consider two possible new assignments of mentors, and suppose the lowest-numbered Gaggler where these assignments differ is Gaggler number $i$. Then if one of the two assignments assigns Gaggler $i$ the same mentor as they originally had, we prefer that assignment. Otherwise, if Gaggler $i$ gets a new mentor in both of the two assignments, then we prefer the assignment where the number of the new mentor of Gaggler $i$ is smaller.\nFor example, consider Sample Input 2 below. One possible new assignment of mentors would be to simply change so that Gaggler $1$ becomes mentored by Gaggler $2$. However, in the best assignment, shown in Sample Output 2, we let Gaggler $1$ keep their current mentor and instead change the mentors of both Gagglers $2$ and $3$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 500000$), the number of Gagglers.

In the year 2020, to protect better their territories, the hamsters have decided to build a great wall surrounding crucial parts of their kingdom.\nThe kingdom of hamsters is represented by a convex polygon with $n$ vertices. Vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$, either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. The $i$-th vertex\u2019s coordinate is $(x_ i, y_ i)$. The hamsters want to choose $6$ unique vertices (among the $n$ vertices) and build a convex hexagonal wall connecting these $6$ vertices. Furthermore, the hamsters want their wall to be as long as possible. In other words, the hexagonal wall should have largest circumference.\nThe hamsters want to know, for each vertex of their kingdom, if they choose this vertex as one of the vertices of the hexagonal wall (along with $5$ other vertices), what is the longest wall they can build?\nEven though the hamsters are technologically advanced, their computers crashed when they executed a brute force code for this problem.

For obvious reasons, L\u00f6kas does not approve of this.

Exactly one bag contains only counterfeit coins (we\u2019ll call this the fake bag), while all other bags contain only real coins. All real coins weigh exactly the same number of grams. All counterfeit coins weigh exactly the same number of grams. You don\u2019t know the exact weights of a real or counterfeit coin. You do know a counterfeit coin is strictly heavier than a real coin, but you do not know exactly how much heavier it is. The weights of the coins are positive real numbers.\nYou have a scale which you can use at most $m$ times. The scale has a left and right side. To use the scale, you can place any number of coins, taken from any of the bags, on each side of the scale, as long as the total number of coins on the left and right sides are exactly equal. The scale will return a single real number $s$. If $s$ is zero, both sides of the scale weigh exactly the same. If $s$ is negative, the left side is $|s|$ grams heavier than the right side. If $s$ is positive, the right side is $s$ grams heavier than the left side. Coins can be reused multiple times for different weighings, and you are able to keep track of which bag each coin came from. You must specify beforehand all weighings you want to perform (so you cannot adjust what gets weighed in future trials based on the results of previous trials). After using the scale $m$ times, you would like to be able to determine which bag is the fake bag.\nYou are now wondering: given $m$ and $k$, what is the maximum number of bags for which you can always determine the fake bag?

However, now that they have a new friend, Ingmariay, they have decided to expand the rules of the game to allow for three-player action:\nInstead of determining a winner for each round of play, they instead score points; the lowest number each of them has claimed during the round is the amount of points they get. (If any of them did not have the opportunity to claim any numbers, the starting number will be their score for that round.) At the end of the day, the player with the fewest points wins. And to avoid bad blood between themselves, they have all agreed that each of them only will focus on minimizing their own scores, and that whenever a player can choose different numbers that will result in the same score, that player will choose the lowest of those numbers.

You immediately bring out the big phaser cannon hoping to take out the flagship before they discover you. There is no room for mistakes and the shot will have to be perfect if you are to stand any chance at all against the flagship of the enemy. \nYou start charging the phaser beam and retrieve the room layout of the flagship from the archives. You are situated directly above the enemy, from where the layout of the flagship can be modeled by a two-dimensional map of the rooms of the flagship. In this map, each room is a rectangle with sides parallel to the $x$ and $y$ axes (rectilinear), and no two rooms intersect (not even in a single point).\nThe phaser beam is configured by giving a point\u00a0$(x, y)$ and an angle\u00a0$\\vartheta $. The phaser beam will start at\u00a0$(x, y)$ and travel a distance\u00a0$\\ell $ in the direction specified by\u00a0$\\vartheta $, causing severe damage to every room touched by the phaser beam. Due to this, you aim at hitting as many rooms as possible.\nThe phaser beam is almost fully charged and the only missing piece is an optimal configuration of the weapon.

Lumen has a special ability where she can shoot a laser beam across the entire map killing all enemies it hits. The only drawback is that the beam is rather narrow and Arnar isn\u2019t always sure where the enemies are located. He now needs your help to determine where the enemies are hiding so he can hit them (and hopefully win the game).\nArnar is very serious about this game and is therefore willing to meticulously research how the opponents move. He knows they only travel in a straight path called the \u2019medial path\u2019. We can therefore describe their location as a function $f$ of a single variable. After much thought Arnar has concluded that $f$ can be described by\\[ c\\int _ a^b \\left(t_1\\Gamma (x) + \\sqrt [t_2]{\\log (\\operatorname {erf}(t_3 x))} - J_ k(x)^{t_4}\\right)dx \\]\nwhere $\\log $ is the natural logarithm,\\[ \\Gamma (z) = \\int _0^{\\infty } x^{z - 1} e^{-x} dx, \\]\\[ \\operatorname {erf}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt {\\pi }} \\int _0^x e^{-t^2} dt, \\]\nand\\[ J_ k(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\int _0^{\\pi } \\cos (k \\tau - x \\sin \\tau ) d \\tau. \\]\nArnar thinks that it maybe a bit tough for you to compute $f$ as previously described so he tells you it is enough to calculate the $r$-th degree Taylor polynomial around $0$, i.e.\\[ P(x) = \\sum _{i = 0}^r \\frac{f^{(i)}(0)}{i!}x^i. \\]\nArnar is a afraid he was too aggressive when approximating $f$ with $P$ so he would like to modify $P$ a little bit further. He knows that as the game progresses his opponent will have more in-game currency and will therefore buy better, more agile shoes. To account for this Arnar recursively defines a sequence of polynomials by\\[ P_0(x) = P(x), \\quad P_ n(x) = \\sum _{i = 0}^{r + n} P_{n - 1}(i) x^i. \\]\nArnar finally notes that during the endgame phase the opponent will probably have to go to the bathroom and to account for that he wants reduce the size of the final polynomial in his sequence. He therefore takes $P_ s$ and differentiates it $\\operatorname {deg}(P_ s) + 1$ times and calls the outcome $g$. Arnar is now satisfied that\\[ \\frac{(g(n) + l)^2}{\\pi e} + \\frac{1}{l + 1} \\]\ngives the location of his opponent. Why does Arnar take the last step? Well, Arnar won\u2019t tell you because he\u2019s afraid you will be able to beat him in Association of Myths if he tells you all his secrets. He also requests that you give him the answer to at least two correct decimal places since his mouse can track changes as small as a hundredth of an in-game unit of length.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input starts with three real numbers $a, b, c$, $-10^9 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq 10^9$ and $1 \\leq c \\leq 10^9$.

Players face a sequence of increasingly devious pool puzzles in which they need to carefully position and aim a single billiards shot to sink multiple pool balls.\nYou\u2019ve just done the first round of user testing and the feedback is terrible \u2014 players complain that the physics of your pool game is neither fun nor intuitive. After digging into it, you realize that the problem isn\u2019t that your physics code is bad, but rather that most people just don\u2019t have much intuition about how physics works. Fortunately, no one requires your physics to be realistic. After this liberating realization, your team experiments with a few models, eventually settling on the following rule for how to resolve pool-ball collisions:\nWhen a moving pool ball B hits a stationary ball A, A begins moving in the direction given by the vector from the center of B to the center of A at the time of the collision. Ball B\u2019s new velocity vector is B\u2019s original vector reflected across A\u2019s new vector (Figure H.1). Note that A\u2019s resulting vector is what real physics predicts, but B\u2019s is not (unless A is glued to the table or has infinite mass). For the purposes of this problem, the speed at which the balls move is irrelevant.\n\u00a0\nFigure H.1\u00a0\nFigure H.2\nThis actually allows for more interesting challenges, but requires new code to determine whether a particular level is feasible. You\u2019ve been tasked with solving a very particular case:\nThree balls labelled $1$, $2$, and $3$ are placed on a table with width $w$ and length $l$ (Figure\u00a0H.2). The player must place the cue ball somewhere on a dashed line lying $h$ units above the bottom edge of the table. The goal is to pick a distance $d$ from the left side, and an angle $\\theta $ such that when the cue ball is shot, the following events happen:\n - The cue ball strikes ball $1$, and then ricochets into ball $2$, sinking ball $2$ in the top left hole.\n - Ball $1$, having been struck by the cue ball, hits ball $3$, sinking ball $3$ in the top right hole.\nFor simplicity, assume that sinking a ball requires the center of the ball to pass directly over the center of the hole. Further assume that the table has no sides \u2014 a ball that goes out of the $w$-by-$l$ region simply falls into a digital abyss \u2014 and thus you don\u2019t need to worry about balls colliding with the table itself.\nYou need to write a program that, given values for $w$, $l$, $h$, the position of balls $1$\u2013$3$, and the radius $r$ of the balls, determines whether the trick shot is possible.\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with a line containing two positive integers $w$ $l$, the width and length of the pool table, where $w, l \\leq 120$. The left hole is at location $(0,l)$ and the right hole is at location $(w,l)$.\nThe next line will contain 8 positive integers $r$ $x_1$ $y_1$ $x_2$ $y_2$ $x_3$ $y_3$ $h$, where $r \\leq 5$ is the radius of all the balls (including the cue ball), $x_ i$ $y_ i$ is the location of ball $i,1 \\leq i \\leq 3$, and $h$ is the distance the dashed line is from the front of the pool table (see the figure above, where $r \\leq h \\leq (1/2)l$). No two balls will ever overlap, though they may touch at a point, and all balls will lie between the dashed line and the back of the table. All balls will lie completely on the table, and the cue ball must also lie completely on the table (otherwise the shot is impossible).\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, display the distance $d$ to place the ball on the dashed line and the angle $\\theta $ to shoot the ball, or the word \u201cimpossible\u201d if the trick shot cannot be done.

For instance, the price of $1106$ megacredits is displayed like this:\nWhile the bartender is busy serving the next customer, you have just enough time to rearrange the price of your favourite beverage to make it as cheap as possible. But be quick about it!\nInvidual magnets can be moved around in any order and turned upside-down. The numbers are shown in a script that makes it difficult for the bartender to distinguish $0$, $1$, and $8$ from their upside-down counterpart. Moreover, $6$ and $9$ look the same when one is turned upside-down. The example price above could be made almost ten times cheaper by turning the first magnet:\nYou have to use all the magnets, otherwise the bartender will immediately suspect foul play.\n-----Input-----\nOn the first line, the number $n$ of magnets, with $1\\in \\{ 1,\\ldots, 1000\\} $. On each of the following $n$ lines, exactly one sequence $m_ i$ of digits describing the $i$th magnet. Each magnet $m_ i$ for $i\\in \\{ 1,\\ldots, n\\} $ consists of at least one and at most $10$ digits from $0$, $1$, $\\ldots $, $9$. The price currently displayed on the bar is the integer described by the juxtaposition $m_1\\cdots m_ n$ of the magnets in the order they are given, from left to right. Note that a magnet can be all $0$s, even though the current price at the bar, alas!, is certainly not.\n-----Output-----\nA single line containing the cheapest price formed by the magnets $m_1,\\ldots,m_ n$, rearranged in any order, and each of them possibly turned upside-down.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2\n110\n6\nSample Output:\n0116\n\ndef",
