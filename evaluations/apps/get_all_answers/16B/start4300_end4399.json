There are lanterns at positions $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$ and $10$, but Vova didn't see the lanterns at positions $4$ and $6$ because of the standing train.\nFor the second example query, the answer is $0$ because the only lantern is at the point $51$ and there is also a standing train at this point.\nFor the third example query, the answer is $1134$ because there are $1234$ lanterns, but Vova didn't see the lanterns from the position $100$ to the position $199$ inclusive.\nFor the fourth example query, the answer is $0$ because the standing train covers the whole path.\n\ndef",

Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.\nMathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:\nSuppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.\nWe denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\\frac{\\sum \\limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).\nYou have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days.

You can apply this operation any number of times for each of the given positions.\nYour task is to determine if it is possible to sort the initial array in non-decreasing order ($a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n$) using only allowed swaps.\nFor example, if $a = [3, 2, 1]$ and $p = [1, 2]$, then we can first swap elements $a[2]$ and $a[3]$ (because position $2$ is contained in the given set $p$).
