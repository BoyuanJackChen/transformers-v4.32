The left bank of the river is cell $0$ and the right bank is cell $n + 1$ (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of $n + 2$ cells numbered from $0$ to $n + 1$). There are also $m$ wooden platforms on a river, the $i$-th platform has length $c_i$ (so the $i$-th platform takes $c_i$ consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed $n$.\nYou are standing at $0$ and want to reach $n+1$ somehow. If you are standing at the position $x$, you can jump to any position in the range $[x + 1; x + d]$. However you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if $d=1$, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells $0$ and $n+1$ belong to wooden platforms.\nYou want to know if it is possible to reach $n+1$ from $0$ if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.\nNote that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).\nFor example, if $n=7$, $m=3$, $d=2$ and $c = [1, 2, 1]$, then one of the ways to reach $8$ from $0$ is follow:\n [Image] The first example: $n=7$. \n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n, m, d \\le 1000, m \\le n$) \u2014 the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.\nThe second line of the input contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le n, \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\le n$), where $c_i$ is the length of the $i$-th platform.\n-----Output-----\nIf it is impossible to reach $n+1$ from $0$, print NO in the first line.

Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform ($1$-indexed, platforms are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in order of input) to which the cell $i$ belongs.\nNote that all $a_i$ equal to $1$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_1$, all $a_i$ equal to $2$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_2$,..., all $a_i$ equal to $m$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_m$. The leftmost position of $2$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $1$, the leftmost position of $3$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $2$,..., the leftmost position of $m$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $m-1$.\nSee example outputs for better understanding.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 2\n1 2 1\nOutput\nYES\n0 1 0 2 2 0 3 \nInput\n10 1 11\n1\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \nInput\n10 1 5\n2\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 \n-----Note-----\nConsider the first example: the answer is $[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]$.

This string is known for you and given in the input.\nAfter that, he erased some letters from the string $s$, and he rewrote the remaining letters in any order. As a result, he got some new string $t$. You have to find it with some additional information.\nSuppose that the string $t$ has length $m$ and the characters are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $m$. You are given a sequence of $m$ integers: $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$, where $b_i$ is the sum of the distances $|i-j|$ from the index $i$ to all such indices $j$ that $t_j > t_i$ (consider that 'a'<'b'<...<'z'). In other words, to calculate $b_i$, Polycarp finds all such indices $j$ that the index $j$ contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than $t_i$ and sums all the values $|i-j|$.\nFor example, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then:  since $t_1$='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is: $b_1=|1-2|+|1-3|+|1-4|=1+2+3=6$;  since $t_2$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_2=|2-3|=1$;  since $t_3$='z', then there are no indexes $j$ such that $t_j>t_i$, thus $b_3=0$;  since $t_4$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_4=|4-3|=1$. \nThus, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then $b=[6,1,0,1]$.\nGiven the string $s$ and the array $b$, find any possible string $t$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:  $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order;  the array, constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $b$ specified in the input data. \n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.

Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $n$ problems in exactly $k$ days.\nThus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list.

To reach this goal, you can insert any integers between any pair of adjacent elements of the array (integers can be really any: positive, negative, $0$, any by absolute value, even such a huge that they can't be represented in most standard programming languages).\nYour task is to find the minimum number of integers you have to insert into Kolya's array in such a way that the resulting array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum $0$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$) \u2014 the number of elements in Kolya's array.\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($-10^{9} \\le a_i \\le 10^{9}, a_i \\neq 0$) \u2014 the description of Kolya's array.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of integers you have to insert into Kolya's array in such a way that the resulting array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum $0$.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 -5 3 2\nOutput\n1\nInput\n5\n4 -2 3 -9 2\nOutput\n0\nInput\n9\n-1 1 -1 1 -1 1 1 -1 -1\nOutput\n6\nInput\n8\n16 -5 -11 -15 10 5 4 -4\nOutput\n3\n-----Note-----\nConsider the first example. There is only one subsegment with the sum $0$. It starts in the second element and ends in the fourth element. It's enough to insert one element so the array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum equal to zero. For example, it is possible to insert the integer $1$ between second and third elements of the array.\nThere are no subsegments having sum $0$ in the second example so you don't need to do anything.\n\ndef",

Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).\nSurely, courseworks are not usually being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least). Some of them require multiple days of hard work.\nLet's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots, a_{i_k}$. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write $a_{i_1}$ pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_2} - 1)$ pages, the third cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_3} - 2)$ pages,..., the $k$-th cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1)$ pages.\nIf Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.\nPolycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it).

It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days in this test.\nIn the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write $4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6$ pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write $4$ pages) so the answer is $2$. It is obvious that Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework in one day in this test.\nIn the third example Polycarp can drink all cups of coffee during first day and write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 15$ pages of coursework.\nIn the fourth example Polycarp cannot drink all cups during first day and should drink one of them during the second day.

A sequence $[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$ is called an arithmetic progression if for each $i$ ($1 \\le i < n$) the value $a_{i+1} - a_i$ is the same. For example, the sequences $[42]$, $[5, 5, 5]$, $[2, 11, 20, 29]$ and $[3, 2, 1, 0]$ are arithmetic progressions, but $[1, 0, 1]$, $[1, 3, 9]$ and $[2, 3, 1]$ are not.\nIt follows from the definition that any sequence of length one or two is an arithmetic progression.\nPolycarp found some sequence of positive integers $[b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n]$. He agrees to change each element by at most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by $1$, an element can be increased by $1$, an element can be left unchanged.\nDetermine a minimum possible number of elements in $b$ which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence $b$ becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.\nIt is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals $0$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000)$ \u2014 the number of elements in $b$.\nThe second line contains a sequence $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ $(1 \\le b_i \\le 10^{9})$.\n-----Output-----\nIf it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression with described operations, print -1.
