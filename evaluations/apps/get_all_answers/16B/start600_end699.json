For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\nA sequence $a$ is a subsegment of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. We will denote the subsegments as $[l, r]$, where $l, r$ are two integers with $1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$. This indicates the subsegment where $l-1$ elements from the beginning and $n-r$ elements from the end are deleted from the sequence.\nFor a permutation $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, we define a framed segment as a subsegment $[l,r]$ where $\\max\\{p_l, p_{l+1}, \\dots, p_r\\} - \\min\\{p_l, p_{l+1}, \\dots, p_r\\} = r - l$. For example, for the permutation $(6, 7, 1, 8, 5, 3, 2, 4)$ some of its framed segments are: $[1, 2], [5, 8], [6, 7], [3, 3], [8, 8]$. In particular, a subsegment $[i,i]$ is always a framed segments for any $i$ between $1$ and $n$, inclusive.\nWe define the happiness of a permutation $p$ as the number of pairs $(l, r)$ such that $1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$, and $[l, r]$ is a framed segment. For example, the permutation $[3, 1, 2]$ has happiness $5$: all segments except $[1, 2]$ are framed segments.\nGiven integers $n$ and $m$, Jongwon wants to compute the sum of happiness for all permutations of length $n$, modulo the prime number $m$.

For some integer numbers $x$ and $d$, he chooses an arbitrary position $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and for every $j \\in [1, n]$ adds $x + d \\cdot dist(i, j)$ to the value of the $j$-th cell. $dist(i, j)$ is the distance between positions $i$ and $j$ (i.e. $dist(i, j) = |i - j|$, where $|x|$ is an absolute value of $x$).\nFor example, if Alice currently has an array $[2, 1, 2, 2]$ and Bob chooses position $3$ for $x = -1$ and $d = 2$ then the array will become $[2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 2,~1 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 1,~2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 0,~2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 1]$ = $[5, 2, 1, 3]$. Note that Bob can't choose position $i$ outside of the array (that is, smaller than $1$ or greater than $n$).\nAlice will be the happiest when the elements of the array are as big as possible. Bob claimed that the arithmetic mean value of the elements will work fine as a metric.\nWhat is the maximum arithmetic mean value Bob can achieve?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of elements of the array and the number of changes.\nEach of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $d_i$ ($-10^3 \\le x_i, d_i \\le 10^3$) \u2014 the parameters for the $i$-th change.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximal average arithmetic mean of the elements Bob can achieve.\nYour answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\n-1 3\n0 0\n-1 -4\nOutput\n-2.500000000000000\nInput\n3 2\n0 2\n5 0\nOutput\n7.000000000000000\n\ndef",

And if he had an integer $n=6$, $n$ will be changed to $8$.\nOrac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.\nNow, for two positive integers $n$ and $k$, Orac asked you to add $f(n)$ to $n$ exactly $k$ times (note that $n$ will change after each operation, so $f(n)$ may change too) and tell him the final value of $n$.\nFor example, if Orac gives you $n=5$ and $k=2$, at first you should add $f(5)=5$ to $n=5$, so your new value of $n$ will be equal to $n=10$, after that, you should add $f(10)=2$ to $10$, so your new (and the final!) value of $n$ will be equal to $12$.\nOrac may ask you these queries many times.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input is a single integer $t\\ (1\\le t\\le 100)$: the number of times that Orac will ask you.\nEach of the next $t$ lines contains two positive integers $n,k\\ (2\\le n\\le 10^6, 1\\le k\\le 10^9)$, corresponding to a query by Orac.\nIt is guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ is at most $10^6$. \n-----Output-----\nPrint $t$ lines, the $i$-th of them should contain the final value of $n$ in the $i$-th query by Orac.\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5 1\n8 2\n3 4\nOutput\n10\n12\n12\n-----Note-----\nIn the first query, $n=5$ and $k=1$. The divisors of $5$ are $1$ and $5$, the smallest one except $1$ is $5$. Therefore, the only operation adds $f(5)=5$ to $5$, and the result is $10$.\nIn the second query, $n=8$ and $k=2$. The divisors of $8$ are $1,2,4,8$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, then after one operation $8$ turns into $8+(f(8)=2)=10$. The divisors of $10$ are $1,2,5,10$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, therefore the answer is $10+(f(10)=2)=12$.\nIn the third query, $n$ is changed as follows: $3 \\to 6 \\to 8 \\to 10 \\to 12$.\n\ndef",

One day, the cities decide that they have too little space and would like to reclaim some of the river area into land.\nThe river area can be represented by a grid with r rows and exactly two columns \u2014 each cell represents a rectangular area. The rows are numbered 1 through r from top to bottom, while the columns are numbered 1 and 2.\nInitially, all of the cells are occupied by the river. The plan is to turn some of those cells into land one by one, with the cities alternately choosing a cell to reclaim, and continuing until no more cells can be reclaimed.\nHowever, the river is also used as a major trade route. The cities need to make sure that ships will still be able to sail from one end of the river to the other. More formally, if a cell (r, c) has been reclaimed, it is not allowed to reclaim any of the cells (r - 1, 3 - c), (r, 3 - c), or (r + 1, 3 - c).\nThe cities are not on friendly terms, and each city wants to be the last city to reclaim a cell (they don't care about how many cells they reclaim, just who reclaims a cell last). The cities have already reclaimed n cells. Your job is to determine which city will be the last to reclaim a cell, assuming both choose cells optimally from current moment.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line consists of two integers r and n (1 \u2264 r \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 n \u2264 r). Then n lines follow, describing the cells that were already reclaimed. Each line consists of two integers: r_{i} and c_{i} (1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 r, 1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 2), which represent the cell located at row r_{i} and column c_{i}. All of the lines describing the cells will be distinct, and the reclaimed cells will not violate the constraints above.\n-----Output-----\nOutput \"WIN\" if the city whose turn it is to choose a cell can guarantee that they will be the last to choose a cell.

The first two possibilities both lose, as they leave exactly one cell for the other city. [Image] \nHowever, reclaiming the cell at (3, 2) leaves no more cells that can be reclaimed, and therefore the first city wins. $\\text{-}$ \nIn the third example, there are no cells that can be reclaimed.\n\ndef",

He intended for each digit to correspond to a distinct direction, and the robot would follow the directions in order to reach the exit. Unfortunately, he forgot to actually assign the directions to digits.\nThe robot will choose some random mapping of digits to distinct directions. The robot will map distinct digits to distinct directions. The robot will then follow the instructions according to the given string in order and chosen mapping. If an instruction would lead the robot to go off the edge of the maze or hit an obstacle, the robot will crash and break down. If the robot reaches the exit at any point, then the robot will stop following any further instructions.\nBob is having trouble debugging his robot, so he would like to determine the number of mappings of digits to directions that would lead the robot to the exit.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input will contain two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 50), denoting the dimensions of the maze.\nThe next n lines will contain exactly m characters each, denoting the maze.\nEach character of the maze will be '.', '#', 'S', or 'E'.\nThere will be exactly one 'S' and exactly one 'E' in the maze.\nThe last line will contain a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the instructions given to the robot. Each character of s is a digit from 0 to 3.\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single integer, the number of mappings of digits to directions that will lead the robot to the exit.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 6\n.....#\nS....#\n.#....\n.#....\n...E..\n333300012\nOutput\n1\nInput\n6 6\n......\n......\n..SE..\n......\n......\n......\n01232123212302123021\nOutput\n14\nInput\n5 3\n...\n.S.\n###\n.E.\n...\n3\nOutput\n0\n-----Note-----\nFor the first sample, the only valid mapping is $0 \\rightarrow D, 1 \\rightarrow L, 2 \\rightarrow U, 3 \\rightarrow R$, where D is down, L is left, U is up, R is right.\n\ndef",

We call a positive integer x for which $a \\operatorname{mod} x = b$ a solution of our equation.\nHamed didn't pay much attention to the class since he was watching a movie. He only managed to understand the definitions of these equations.\nNow he wants to write his math exercises but since he has no idea how to do that, he asked you for help.

Anya has lots of candles prepared for the visits, each candle can produce light for exactly t seconds. It takes the girl one second to light one candle. More formally, Anya can spend one second to light one candle, then this candle burns for exactly t seconds and then goes out and can no longer be used.\nFor each of the m ghosts Anya knows the time at which it comes: the i-th visit will happen w_{i} seconds after midnight, all w_{i}'s are distinct. Each visit lasts exactly one second.\nWhat is the minimum number of candles Anya should use so that during each visit, at least r candles are burning? Anya can start to light a candle at any time that is integer number of seconds from midnight, possibly, at the time before midnight. That means, she can start to light a candle integer number of seconds before midnight or integer number of seconds after a midnight, or in other words in any integer moment of time.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers m, t, r (1 \u2264 m, t, r \u2264 300), representing the number of ghosts to visit Anya, the duration of a candle's burning and the minimum number of candles that should burn during each visit. \nThe next line contains m space-separated numbers w_{i} (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 w_{i} \u2264 300), the i-th of them repesents at what second after the midnight the i-th ghost will come.

For example, Anya can start lighting them at the 3-rd, 5-th and 7-th seconds after the midnight.\nIn the second sample test one candle is enough. For example, Anya can start lighting it one second before the midnight.\nIn the third sample test the answer is  - 1, since during each second at most one candle can burn but Anya needs three candles to light up the room at the moment when the ghost comes.\n\ndef",

By definition, for a set {x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4} (x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 x_3 \u2264 x_4) arithmetic mean is $\\frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4}}{4}$, median is $\\frac{x_{2} + x_{3}}{2}$ and range is x_4 - x_1. The arithmetic mean and median are not necessary integer. It is well-known that if those three numbers are same, boxes will create a \"debugging field\" and codes in the field will have no bugs.\nFor example, 1, 1, 3, 3 is the example of 4 numbers meeting the condition because their mean, median and range are all equal to 2.\nJeff has 4 special boxes of candies.

After jumping from the plane, he will fly in the same direction as the plane, parallel to $Ox$ axis, covering a unit of distance every second.

This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let's have a look at the Soroban's construction. [Image] \nSoroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called go-dama and four others are ichi-damas. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm:  Set the value of a digit equal to 0.  If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5.  Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left. \nThus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.\nWrite the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number n.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer n (0 \u2264 n < 10^9).\n-----Output-----\nPrint the description of the decimal digits of number n from the last one to the first one (as mentioned on the picture in the statement), one per line.

Polycarpus knows values a and b.\nHelp Polycarpus and find any suitable method to cut the public key.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains the public key of the messenger \u2014 an integer without leading zeroes, its length is in range from 1 to 10^6 digits. The second line contains a pair of space-separated positive integers a, b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 10^8).\n-----Output-----\nIn the first line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the method satisfying conditions above exists. In this case, next print two lines \u2014 the left and right parts after the cut. These two parts, being concatenated, must be exactly identical to the public key. The left part must be divisible by a, and the right part must be divisible by b. The two parts must be positive integers having no leading zeros. If there are several answers, print any of them.\nIf there is no answer, print in a single line \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n116401024\n97 1024\nOutput\nYES\n11640\n1024\nInput\n284254589153928171911281811000\n1009 1000\nOutput\nYES\n2842545891539\n28171911281811000\nInput\n120\n12 1\nOutput\nNO\n\ndef",

One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length $n+m$ such that some $n$ of its elements are equal to $1$ and another $m$ elements are equal to $-1$. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to $0$ (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero). Formally, denote as $f(a)$ the maximal prefix sum of an array $a_{1, \\ldots,l}$ of length $l \\geq 0$.

However, Uzhland doesn't have good internet connection, so Sereja sometimes skips rounds.\nCodesorfes has rounds of two types: Div1 (for advanced coders) and Div2 (for beginner coders). Two rounds, Div1 and Div2, can go simultaneously, (Div1 round cannot be held without Div2) in all other cases the rounds don't overlap in time. Each round has a unique identifier \u2014 a positive integer. The rounds are sequentially (without gaps) numbered with identifiers by the starting time of the round. The identifiers of rounds that are run simultaneously are different by one, also the identifier of the Div1 round is always greater.\nSereja is a beginner coder, so he can take part only in rounds of Div2 type. At the moment he is taking part in a Div2 round, its identifier equals to x. Sereja remembers very well that he has taken part in exactly k rounds before this round. Also, he remembers all identifiers of the rounds he has taken part in and all identifiers of the rounds that went simultaneously with them. Sereja doesn't remember anything about the rounds he missed.\nSereja is wondering: what minimum and what maximum number of Div2 rounds could he have missed? Help him find these two numbers.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers: x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 4000) \u2014 the round Sereja is taking part in today, and k (0 \u2264 k < 4000) \u2014 the number of rounds he took part in.\nNext k lines contain the descriptions of the rounds that Sereja took part in before. If Sereja took part in one of two simultaneous rounds, the corresponding line looks like: \"1 num_2 num_1\" (where num_2 is the identifier of this Div2 round, num_1 is the identifier of the Div1 round). It is guaranteed that num_1 - num_2 = 1. If Sereja took part in a usual Div2 round, then the corresponding line looks like: \"2 num\" (where num is the identifier of this Div2 round). It is guaranteed that the identifiers of all given rounds are less than x.\n-----Output-----\nPrint in a single line two integers \u2014 the minimum and the maximum number of rounds that Sereja could have missed.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n2 1\n2 2\nOutput\n0 0\nInput\n9 3\n1 2 3\n2 8\n1 4 5\nOutput\n2 3\nInput\n10 0\nOutput\n5 9\n-----Note-----\nIn the second sample we have unused identifiers of rounds 1, 6, 7. The minimum number of rounds Sereja could have missed equals to 2. In this case, the round with the identifier 1 will be a usual Div2 round and the round with identifier 6 will be synchronous with the Div1 round. \nThe maximum number of rounds equals 3. In this case all unused identifiers belong to usual Div2 rounds.\n\ndef",
