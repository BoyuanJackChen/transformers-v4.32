The state of the restaurant is described by a string of length $n$ which contains characters \"1\" (the table is occupied) and \"0\" (the table is empty).\nRestaurant rules prohibit people to sit at a distance of $k$ or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number $i$, then all tables with numbers from $i-k$ to $i+k$ (except for the $i$-th) should be free. In other words, the absolute difference of the numbers of any two occupied tables must be strictly greater than $k$.\nFor example, if $n=8$ and $k=2$, then:  strings \"10010001\", \"10000010\", \"00000000\", \"00100000\" satisfy the rules of the restaurant;  strings \"10100100\", \"10011001\", \"11111111\" do not satisfy to the rules of the restaurant, since each of them has a pair of \"1\" with a distance less than or equal to $k=2$. \nIn particular, if the state of the restaurant is described by a string without \"1\" or a string with one \"1\", then the requirement of the restaurant is satisfied.\nYou are given a binary string $s$ that describes the current state of the restaurant.

To reach this target, he will throw out the leftmost object from the set until the remaining set of objects can be packed in boxes he has. Your task is to say the maximum number of objects Maksim can pack in boxes he has.\nEach time when Maksim tries to pack the objects into the boxes, he will make empty all the boxes he has before do it (and the relative order of the remaining set of objects will not change).\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le k \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the number of objects, the number of boxes and the size of each box.\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le k$), where $a_i$ is the size of the $i$-th object.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum number of objects Maksim can pack using the algorithm described in the problem statement.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 6\n5 2 1 4 2\nOutput\n4\nInput\n5 1 4\n4 2 3 4 1\nOutput\n1\nInput\n5 3 3\n1 2 3 1 1\nOutput\n5\n-----Note-----\nIn the first example Maksim can pack only $4$ objects. Firstly, he tries to pack all the $5$ objects. Distribution of objects will be $[5], [2, 1]$. Maxim cannot pack the next object in the second box and he has no more empty boxes at all. Next he will throw out the first object and the objects distribution will be $[2, 1], [4, 2]$. So the answer is $4$.\nIn the second example it is obvious that Maksim cannot pack all the objects starting from first, second, third and fourth (in all these cases the distribution of objects is $[4]$), but he can pack the last object ($[1]$).\nIn the third example Maksim can pack all the objects he has.

The characters of both strings have indices from $1$ to $n$, inclusive. \nYou are allowed to do the following changes:   Choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $b_i$;  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $a_{n - i + 1}$;  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and swap characters $b_i$ and $b_{n - i + 1}$. \nNote that if $n$ is odd, you are formally allowed to swap $a_{\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil}$ with $a_{\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil}$ (and the same with the string $b$) but this move is useless. Also you can swap two equal characters but this operation is useless as well.\nYou have to make these strings equal by applying any number of changes described above, in any order. But it is obvious that it may be impossible to make two strings equal by these swaps.\nIn one preprocess move you can replace a character in $a$ with another character. In other words, in a single preprocess move you can choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$), any character $c$ and set $a_i := c$.\nYour task is to find the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply in such a way that after them you can make strings $a$ and $b$ equal by applying some number of changes described in the list above.\nNote that the number of changes you make after the preprocess moves does not matter.

There is no way to use fewer than $4$ preprocess moves before a sequence of changes to make string equal, so the answer in this example is $4$.\nIn the second example no preprocess moves are required.

At the end of the second day the book of the $1$-st kid will belong to the $3$-th kid, the $2$-nd kid will belong to the $2$-th kid and so on.\nYour task is to determine the number of the day the book of the $i$-th child is returned back to him for the first time for every $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\nConsider the following example: $p = [5, 1, 2, 4, 3]$. The book of the $1$-st kid will be passed to the following kids:  after the $1$-st day it will belong to the $5$-th kid,  after the $2$-nd day it will belong to the $3$-rd kid,  after the $3$-rd day it will belong to the $2$-nd kid,  after the $4$-th day it will belong to the $1$-st kid. \nSo after the fourth day, the book of the first kid will return to its owner.

He is allowed to choose the order in which he will knock the cans down.\nVasya knows that the durability of the $i$-th can is $a_i$. It means that if Vasya has already knocked $x$ cans down and is now about to start shooting the $i$-th one, he will need $(a_i \\cdot x + 1)$ shots to knock it down. You can assume that if Vasya starts shooting the $i$-th can, he will be shooting it until he knocks it down.\nYour task is to choose such an order of shooting so that the number of shots required to knock each of the $n$ given cans down exactly once is minimum possible.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ $(2 \\le n \\le 1\\,000)$ \u2014 the number of cans.\nThe second line of the input contains the sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ $(1 \\le a_i \\le 1\\,000)$, where $a_i$ is the durability of the $i$-th can.\n-----Output-----\nIn the first line print the minimum number of shots required to knock each of the $n$ given cans down exactly once.\nIn the second line print the sequence consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ \u2014 the order of indices of cans that minimizes the number of shots required.
