        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Berkomnadzor\u00a0\u2014 Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media\u00a0\u2014 is a Berland federal executive body that protects ordinary residents of Berland from the threats of modern internet.\nBerkomnadzor maintains a list of prohibited IPv4 subnets (blacklist) and a list of allowed IPv4 subnets (whitelist). All Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Berland must configure the network equipment to block access to all IPv4 addresses matching the blacklist. Also ISPs must provide access (that is, do not block) to all IPv4 addresses matching the whitelist. If an IPv4 address does not match either of those lists, it's up to the ISP to decide whether to block it or not. An IPv4 address matches the blacklist (whitelist) if and only if it matches some subnet from the blacklist (whitelist). An IPv4 address can belong to a whitelist and to a blacklist at the same time, this situation leads to a contradiction (see no solution case in the output description).\nAn IPv4 address is a 32-bit unsigned integer written in the form $a.b.c.d$, where each of the values $a,b,c,d$ is called an octet and is an integer from $0$ to $255$ written in decimal notation. For example, IPv4 address $192.168.0.1$ can be converted to a 32-bit number using the following expression $192 \\cdot 2^{24} + 168 \\cdot 2^{16} + 0 \\cdot 2^8 + 1 \\cdot 2^0$. First octet $a$ encodes the most significant (leftmost) $8$ bits, the octets $b$ and $c$\u00a0\u2014 the following blocks of $8$ bits (in this order), and the octet $d$ encodes the least significant (rightmost) $8$ bits.\nThe IPv4 network in Berland is slightly different from the rest of the world. There are no reserved or internal addresses in Berland and use all $2^{32}$ possible values.\nAn IPv4 subnet is represented either as $a.b.c.d$ or as $a.b.c.d/x$ (where $0 \\le x \\le 32$). A subnet $a.b.c.d$ contains a single address $a.b.c.d$. A subnet $a.b.c.d/x$ contains all IPv4 addresses with $x$ leftmost (most significant) bits equal to $x$ leftmost bits of the address $a.b.c.d$. It is required that $32 - x$ rightmost (least significant) bits of subnet $a.b.c.d/x$ are zeroes.\nNaturally it happens that all addresses matching subnet $a.b.c.d/x$ form a continuous range. The range starts with address $a.b.c.d$ (its rightmost $32 - x$ bits are zeroes). The range ends with address which $x$ leftmost bits equal to $x$ leftmost bits of address $a.b.c.d$, and its $32 - x$ rightmost bits are all ones. Subnet contains exactly $2^{32-x}$ addresses. Subnet $a.b.c.d/32$ contains exactly one address and can also be represented by just $a.b.c.d$.\nFor example subnet $192.168.0.0/24$ contains range of 256 addresses. $192.168.0.0$ is the first address of the range, and $192.168.0.255$ is the last one.\nBerkomnadzor's engineers have devised a plan to improve performance of Berland's global network. Instead of maintaining both whitelist and blacklist they want to build only a single optimised blacklist containing minimal number of subnets. The idea is to block all IPv4 addresses matching the optimised blacklist and allow all the rest addresses. Of course, IPv4 addresses from the old blacklist must remain blocked and all IPv4 addresses from the old whitelist must still be allowed. Those IPv4 addresses which matched neither the old blacklist nor the old whitelist may be either blocked or allowed regardless of their accessibility before. \nPlease write a program which takes blacklist and whitelist as input and produces optimised blacklist. The optimised blacklist must contain the minimal possible number of subnets and satisfy all IPv4 addresses accessibility requirements mentioned above. \nIPv4 subnets in the source lists may intersect arbitrarily. Please output a single number -1 if some IPv4 address matches both source whitelist and blacklist.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 total number of IPv4 subnets in the input.\nThe following $n$ lines contain IPv4 subnets. Each line starts with either '-' or '+' sign, which indicates if the subnet belongs to the blacklist or to the whitelist correspondingly. It is followed, without any spaces, by the IPv4 subnet in $a.b.c.d$ or $a.b.c.d/x$ format ($0 \\le x \\le 32$). The blacklist always contains at least one subnet.\nAll of the IPv4 subnets given in the input are valid. Integer numbers do not start with extra leading zeroes. The provided IPv4 subnets can intersect arbitrarily.\n-----Output-----\nOutput -1, if there is an IPv4 address that matches both the whitelist and the blacklist. Otherwise output $t$ \u2014 the length of the optimised blacklist, followed by $t$ subnets, with each subnet on a new line. Subnets may be printed in arbitrary order. All addresses matching the source blacklist must match the optimised blacklist. All addresses matching the source whitelist must not match the optimised blacklist. You can print a subnet $a.b.c.d/32$ in any of two ways: as $a.b.c.d/32$ or as $a.b.c.d$.\nIf there is more than one solution, output any.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n-149.154.167.99\nOutput\n1\n0.0.0.0/0\nInput\n4\n-149.154.167.99\n+149.154.167.100/30\n+149.154.167.128/25\n-149.154.167.120/29\nOutput\n2\n149.154.167.99\n149.154.167.120/29\nInput\n5\n-127.0.0.4/31\n+127.0.0.8\n+127.0.0.0/30\n-195.82.146.208/29\n-127.0.0.6/31\nOutput\n2\n195.0.0.0/8\n127.0.0.4/30\nInput\n2\n+127.0.0.1/32\n-127.0.0.1\nOutput\n-1\n\ndef",

It is guaranteed, that there are no multiple edges, that is any pair of vertexes appear in this list no more than once.\n-----Output-----\nIn the first line print \"Yes\" (without the quotes), if the string s Petya is interested in really exists and \"No\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nIf the string s exists, then print it on the second line of the output. The length of s must be exactly n, it must consist of only letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" only, and the graph built using this string must coincide with G. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 1\n1 2\nOutput\nYes\naa\nInput\n4 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\nOutput\nNo\n-----Note-----\nIn the first sample you are given a graph made of two vertices with an edge between them. So, these vertices can correspond to both the same and adjacent letters. Any of the following strings \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\", \"cb\", \"cc\" meets the graph's conditions. \nIn the second sample the first vertex is connected to all three other vertices, but these three vertices are not connected with each other. That means that they must correspond to distinct letters that are not adjacent, but that is impossible as there are only two such letters: a and c.\n\ndef",

It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:   Only one disk can be moved at a time.  Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.  No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. \nWith three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^{n} - 1, where n is the number of disks. (c) Wikipedia.\nSmallY's puzzle is very similar to the famous Tower of Hanoi.

He studies in a special school and his grade can be equal to any positive decimal fraction. First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer). \nThere are t seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than t seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all t seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all.\nIn this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the n-th digit one has to take a look at the digit n + 1. If it is less than 5 than the n-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the n + 1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position n is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. At the end, all trailing zeroes are thrown away.\nFor example, if the number 1.14 is rounded to the first decimal place, the result is 1.1, while if we round 1.5 to the nearest integer, the result is 2. Rounding number 1.299996121 in the fifth decimal place will result in number 1.3.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the length of Efim's grade and the number of seconds till the end of the break respectively.\nThe second line contains the grade itself. It's guaranteed that the grade is a positive number, containing at least one digit after the decimal points, and it's representation doesn't finish with 0.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum grade that Efim can get in t seconds. Do not print trailing zeroes.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 1\n10.245\nOutput\n10.25\nInput\n6 2\n10.245\nOutput\n10.3\nInput\n3 100\n9.2\nOutput\n9.2\n-----Note-----\nIn the first two samples Efim initially has grade 10.245. \nDuring the first second Efim can obtain grade 10.25, and then 10.3 during the next second. Note, that the answer 10.30 will be considered incorrect.\nIn the third sample the optimal strategy is to not perform any rounding at all.\n\ndef",

This problem deals with a simplified version of the game.\nOverall, the game has 25 types of cards (5 distinct colors and 5 distinct values). Borya is holding n cards. The game is somewhat complicated by the fact that everybody sees Borya's cards except for Borya himself. Borya knows which cards he has but he knows nothing about the order they lie in. Note that Borya can have multiple identical cards (and for each of the 25 types of cards he knows exactly how many cards of this type he has).\nThe aim of the other players is to achieve the state when Borya knows the color and number value of each of his cards. For that, other players can give him hints.

They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before.

To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.\nThere are $n$ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $i$-th banknote is $a_i$. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.\nMartians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet.\nDetermine for which values $d$ Natasha can make the Martians happy.\nNatasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$, $2 \\le k \\le 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of denominations of banknotes and the base of the number system on Mars.\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 denominations of banknotes on Mars.\nAll numbers are given in decimal notation.\n-----Output-----\nOn the first line output the number of values $d$ for which Natasha can make the Martians happy.\nIn the second line, output all these values in increasing order.\nPrint all numbers in decimal notation.\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 8\n12 20\nOutput\n2\n0 4 \nInput\n3 10\n10 20 30\nOutput\n1\n0 \n-----Note-----\nConsider the first test case. It uses the octal number system.\nIf you take one banknote with the value of $12$, you will get $14_8$ in octal system. The last digit is $4_8$.\nIf you take one banknote with the value of $12$ and one banknote with the value of $20$, the total value will be $32$. In the octal system, it is $40_8$. The last digit is $0_8$.\nIf you take two banknotes with the value of $20$, the total value will be $40$, this is $50_8$ in the octal system. The last digit is $0_8$.\nNo other digits other than $0_8$ and $4_8$ can be obtained. Digits $0_8$ and $4_8$ could also be obtained in other ways.\nThe second test case uses the decimal number system. The nominals of all banknotes end with zero, so Natasha can give the Martians only the amount whose decimal notation also ends with zero.\n\ndef",

In a few moments they were ready, and the dirigible of the rescue chipmunks hit the road.\nWe assume that the action takes place on a Cartesian plane. The headquarters of the rescuers is located at point (x_1, y_1), and the distress signal came from the point (x_2, y_2).\nDue to Gadget's engineering talent, the rescuers' dirigible can instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at any moment and as many times as needed. The only limitation is: the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed $v_{\\operatorname{max}}$ meters per second.\nOf course, Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the destination as soon as possible. The matter is complicated by the fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the movement of the dirigible. According to the weather forecast, the wind will be defined by the vector (v_{x}, v_{y}) for the nearest t seconds, and then will change to (w_{x}, w_{y}). These vectors give both the direction and velocity of the wind. Formally, if a dirigible is located at the point (x, y), while its own velocity relative to the air is equal to zero and the wind (u_{x}, u_{y}) is blowing, then after $T$ seconds the new position of the dirigible will be $(x + \\tau \\cdot u_{x}, y + \\tau \\cdot u_{y})$.\nGadget is busy piloting the aircraft, so she asked Chip to calculate how long will it take them to reach the destination if they fly optimally. He coped with the task easily, but Dale is convinced that Chip has given the random value, aiming only not to lose the face in front of Gadget. Dale has asked you to find the right answer.\nIt is guaranteed that the speed of the wind at any moment of time is strictly less than the maximum possible speed of the airship relative to the air.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (|x_1|,  |y_1|,  |x_2|,  |y_2| \u2264 10 000)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the rescuers' headquarters and the point, where signal of the distress came from, respectively. \nThe second line contains two integers $v_{\\operatorname{max}}$ and t (0 < v, t \u2264 1000), which are denoting the maximum speed of the chipmunk dirigible relative to the air and the moment of time when the wind changes according to the weather forecast, respectively. \nNext follow one per line two pairs of integer (v_{x}, v_{y}) and (w_{x}, w_{y}), describing the wind for the first t seconds and the wind that will blow at all the remaining time, respectively. It is guaranteed that $v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2} < v_{\\operatorname{max}}^{2}$ and $w_{x}^{2} + w_{y}^{2} < v_{\\operatorname{max}}^{2}$.\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single real value\u00a0\u2014 the minimum time the rescuers need to get to point (x_2, y_2).
