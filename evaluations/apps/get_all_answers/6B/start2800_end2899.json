They start by creating $P$ piles with all cards face-up and select a non-negative number $K$. After that, they take turns like this:\n - A player starts by selecting one of the piles.\n - Then, he removes from $0$ up to $K$ cards from the top of that pile, leaving at least one card in the pile.\n - Next, he looks at the card left at the top of the pile and must remove a number of cards equal to its value (from the top of the same pile).\nWhoever doesn\u2019t have more cards to remove, or whoever is forced to remove more cards than those available on a pile, loses the game.In the figure, you can see an example with two piles and $K = 1$. The player to move might: \n - Select the first pile and $0$ cards to remove, being forced to remove $1$ card from the top next.\n - Select the second pile and $0$ cards to remove, having to remove $1$ card from the top next.\n - Select the second pile and $1$ card to remove, having to remove $2$ cards from the top next.\nAlice has realized that Bob is very good at this game and will always win if he has the chance. Luckily, this time Alice is first to play. Is Alice able to win this game?\n-----Task-----\nGiven the description of the piles with all the cards and the maximum number of cards they can start to remove, your goal is to find out whether Alice can win the game if she is the first to play.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains $2$ space separated integers, $P$, the number of piles, and $K$, the maximum number of cards they can start to remove on their turn.

Pizza World is a food festival, where all stands have their own special type of pizza. Margriet would really like to try many different types of pizza, but she thinks that she can only eat two pizzas in total. Therefore, she has come up with a cunning plan: at each stall she visits she decides whether she wants to buy this pizza or not. At the first stall where she decides to make a purchase, she buys and eats exactly one pizza. At the second one, she buys and eats half a pizza, and at the third she eats one quarter of a pizza, etc. \u2026Therefore, at the $k^\\textrm {th}$ stall where she decides to buy some pizza, she eats $\\frac1{2^{k-1}}^\\textrm {th}$ part of a pizza. This way she makes sure that she never gets full!\nIn order to ensure that the flow of people in the park is adequate, the pizza stalls are connected by one-way paths, and to make sure that everyone eventually leaves the festival, it is impossible to visit a pizza stall more than once. However, every stall is reachable from the stall at the entrance, which is the stall with number $0$.\nOf course, Margriet has her own taste: she likes some pizzas more than others. Eating pizza from a stall gives her a certain amount of satisfaction which is equal to Margriet\u2019s personal stall satisfaction number multiplied by the fraction of a whole pizza she eats there. Her total satisfaction is the sum of satisfactions of every stall she visits. Can you help Margriet plot a route between the pizza stalls that satisfies her the most?\n-----Input-----\n - The first line has two integers, $1\\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$ and $0\\leq m \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$, the number of pizza stalls and the number of one way connections.\n - The second line has $n$ integers $c_0, \\dots, c_{n-1}$, where each $0\\leq c_ i \\leq 10^9$, the amount of satisfaction Margriet gets from eating one pizza at stall $i$.\n - The next $m$ lines each contain $2$ integers, $0\\leq s<n$ and $0\\leq t<n$, indicating a one way path from stall $s$ to stall $t$.

The standard Concentration game is played with one or two 52-card decks, however, for the sake of the problem, we will look at a variation of Concentration.\nThe rules are as follows:\n - A card is represented by a single integer. Two cards $i$, $j$ are considered \u201csimilar\u201d if and only if $\\lfloor i/2\\rfloor =\\lfloor j/2\\rfloor $. A deck consisting of $2N$ cards is used for each game. More specifically, a deck of $2N$ cards contains exactly one copy of card $i$ for all $0\\leq i <2N$.\n - All cards are initially facing down on a table in random positions, i.e. neither players know what any cards are. Players take turns making moves. Player 0 goes first, then player 1 goes, then player 0 goes, and so on.\n - During each turn, a player chooses two cards and reveals them. If the two cards are \u201csimilar\u201d, then they are removed from the table and the player gets to keep them, the player is then granted another turn; this can happen infinitely as long as the player always finds two \u201csimilar\u201d cards. If the cards are different, the player\u2019s turn ends.\n - When there are no more cards on the table, the player with more cards wins the game.\nAnthony and Matthew like to play this boring game and share an identical play style: whenever they are to choose a card to reveal, if they have knowledge of two \u201csimilar\u201d cards, they will pick one of the two \u201csimilar\u201d cards; otherwise they will pick a random unknown card to reveal.\nAnthony and Matthew are both extremely intelligent and have perfect memories, i.e. they remember every card that has been revealed.\nBefore the game starts, both Anthony and Matthew make up their minds about in which order they will choose random cards to reveal, in case when they do not have knowledge of two \u201csimilar\u201d cards.\nEach player\u2019s choices of revelation can be represented by a permutation of numbers $[0,\\ldots, 2N-1]$.

Unfortunately, both buffalo were hitched on the left side and the entire sleigh flipped over in mid-flight due to the weight imbalance.\nTo prevent such accidents in the future, Santa needs to divide the animals for a given trip into two groups such that the sum of the weights of all animals in one group equals the sum of the weights of all animals in the other. To make the hitching process efficient, Santa is seeking an integer target weight $t$ such that all animals that are lighter than $t$ go in one group and those heavier than $t$ go into the other. If there are multiple such $t$, he wants the smallest one. There\u2019s one small wrinkle: what should be done if there some animals have weight exactly equal to $t$? Santa solves the problem this way: if there are an even number of such animals, he divides them equally among the two groups (thus distributing the weight evenly). But if there are an odd number of such animals, then one of those animals is sent to work with the elves to make toys (it is not put in either group), and the remaining (now an even number) are divided evenly among the two groups.\n-----Input-----\nInput describes a list of animals\u2019 weights.

The ellipse consists of all points $p$ such that $\\mathop {\\mathrm{distance}}(f_1, p) + \\mathop {\\mathrm{distance}}(f_2, p) = D$.\nWhen one normally thinks of ellipses, it is in the context of the Euclidean 2D plane, with the Euclidean distance as a distance measure.\nThis problem explores a different kind of ellipse. The space we will work in is the space of words of length $n$ using an alphabet of $q$ different symbols, often denoted as $F_ q^n$. As you can probably see, for given values of $q$ and $n$, there are $q^n$ different words (points) in the space $F_ q^n$.\nFor a distance measure, we use the Hamming distance. The Hamming distance between two words $x, y \\in F_ q^n$ is simply the number of positions where the symbols that make up the words $x$ and $y$ differ. For example, the Hamming distance between words 01201 and 21210 is 3 because there are 3 positions where the words have different symbols. The Hamming distance between any two words in $F_ q^n$ will always be an integer between $0$ and $n$, inclusive.\nWithin the space $F_ q^n$, we now define the Hamming ellipse as the set of all points $p$ such that $\\mathop {\\mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_1, p) + \\mathop {\\mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_2, p) = D$.

Hoppers can operate in any high-security computer networks; however, they can only propagate themselves in a very limited way.\nA computer network is a set of hosts $V$ ($|V| = N$) and direct links $E$ ($|E| = M$). Each direct link connects two different hosts, allowing them to communicate in both directions. If a host $u$ is infected with a hopper, then it will propagate itself to all hosts $W$ where $W$ is the set of hosts which are connected to any neighbor of $u$. Formally, $W = \\{ w \\mid \\{ (u,v),(v,w)\\} \\subseteq E \\} $.

In this network, there is no way to spread the hopper to all hosts by compromising only a single host, e.g., if we compromise host $1$, then only hosts $1$ and $3$ are infected, etc. We need to submit one IT request to connect $(1,3)$ to achieve our goal.

If there are $n$ pixels that have original red values $r_1, \\ldots, r_ n$, and $k$ allowed integers $v_1, \\ldots, v_ k$, the sum of squared errors is defined as\\[ \\sum _{i=1}^n \\min _{1 \\leq j \\leq k} (r_ i - v_ j)^2. \\]\nYour task is to compute the minimum achievable sum of squared errors, given parameter\u00a0$k$ and a description of the red intensities of an image\u2019s pixels.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $d$ ($1 \\leq d \\leq 256$), the number of distinct red values that occur in the original image, and $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq d$), the number of distinct red values allowed in the posterized image. The remaining $d$ lines indicate the number of pixels of the image having various red values. Each such line contains two integers $r$ ($0 \\leq r \\leq 255$) and $p$ ($1 \\leq p \\leq 2^{26}$), where $r$ is a red intensity value and $p$ is the number of pixels having red intensity $r$. Those $d$ lines are given in increasing order of red value.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the sum of the squared errors for an optimally chosen set of $k$ allowed integer values.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 1\n50 20000\n150 10000\nSample Output 1:\n66670000\nSample Input 2:\n2 2\n50 20000\n150 10000\nSample Output 2:\n0\n\ndef",

VisuAlgo visualizes a number of popular data structures and algorithms in the Computer Science curriculum. Currently, it receives approximately 2000 hits/day from CS students and instructors worldwide.\nOne new feature of VisuAlgo is the online quiz. As an example, the above figure shows a question about the classic Single-Source (Single-Destination) Shortest Paths problem in graph theory. The beauty of this online quiz feature is that the question parameters are randomized. The drawn graph G is taken from a collection of hundreds of directed weighted graphs (with their 2-D layouts) in VisuAlgo\u2019s internal database. The graph G has $V$ vertices numbered from $[0..V-1]$. The source vertex $s$ and the destination vertex $t$ are selected at random from $[0..V-1]$.\nHowever, such randomization of the question parameters may produce either a trivial question (e.g. \u201cNo Answer\u201d when $s$ and $t$ are disconnected, $0$ when $s = t$, simple tracing of a path if there is only a single unique path from $s$ to $t$ as shown in the above figure) or insanely difficult question to be computed manually if there are too many possible shortest paths from $s$ to $t$.\nThe developers of VisuAlgo want to calibrate such Shortest Paths question with randomized parameters so that it is possible for a normal Computer Science student to answer the randomly generated question manually within a reasonable amount of time.

Her advisor believes she should only submit the papers with \u201cgood enough\u201d results so they have a high chance of getting accepted. \nAngela\u2019s research group has a unique way of evaluating the success of paper submissions. They use the research productivity index, defined as $a^{a/s}$, where $s$ is the total number of papers submitted, and $a$ is the number of papers that are accepted by the conference. When $a = 0$, the index is defined to be zero. For example:\n - if one paper is submitted and it gets accepted, the index is $1^{1/1} = 1$;\n - if $4$ papers are submitted and all get accepted, the index is $4^{4/4} = 4$;\n - if $10$ papers are submitted and $3$ get accepted, the index is $3^{3/10} \\approx 1.390389$;\n - if $5$ papers are submitted and $4$ get accepted, the index is $4^{4/5} \\approx 3.031433$;\n - if $3$ papers are submitted and all get rejected ($a=0$), the index is $0$.\nIntuitively, to get a high research productivity index one wants to get as many papers accepted as possible while keeping the acceptance rate high.\nFor each of her $n$ papers, Angela knows exactly how likely it is that the conference would accept the paper.

Before running any real experiments it is better to do a simulation to test out the ideas first. You are required to write a very simple simulator for this problem.\nThere are only three particles in this system, and all particles are confined to an infinite plane so that they can be modelled as circles. Their locations are specified only by the $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ coordinates of their centers ($1 \\leq i \\leq 3$). All three particles have the same radius $r$, and are initially stationary.\nWe are given a vector $(x_ v, y_ v)$ specifying the direction particle $1$ will move when the experiment starts. When particle $i$ hits particle $j$, particle $j$ will start moving in the direction perpendicular to the tangent at the point of the contact, away from particle $i$.

A Wardrobe Specialist charges a flat rate per recital that covers all normal changes, but charges an exorbitant amount for each quick change. The Production Manager is responsible for keeping the show under budget, and has hired you to write a program to report the minimum number of quick changes needed for a given recital, given that the order of the dance routines could be changed.\nTo describe the cast of dancers that are to perform during a recital, each dancer is assigned an identifying uppercase letter. (Fortunately, there are never more than 26 dancers, so characters from A to Z suffice.) To describe a full recital, a list of individual routines is given, with a string of characters defining which dancers appear in a routine.

The object of the game is to determine who murdered Mr.\u00a0Body, which weapon was used to murder him, and where the murder took place. The game uses a set of cards representing six persons (labeled A, B, \u2026, F), six weapons (labeled G, H, \u2026, L) and nine rooms (labeled M, N, \u2026, U). At the start of the game, one person card, one weapon card, and one room card are selected at random and removed from the deck so no one can see them \u2013 they represent the murderer, the murder weapon, and the murder location. The remaining $18$ cards are shuffled and dealt to the players, starting with player $1$, then to her right player $2$, and so on. Some players may end up with one more card than others. For the purposes of this problem there are four players, so the person to the right of player $4$ is player $1$.\nThe rest of the game is spent searching for clues. Players take turns, starting with player 1 and moving to the right. A turn consists of making a suggestion (consisting of a murder suspect, a weapon, and a room) and asking other players if they have any evidence that refutes the suggestion. For example, you might say to another player \u201cI believe the murderer was person A, using weapon L, in room T.\u201d If the other player is holding exactly one of these cards, that player must show you (and only you) that card. If they have more than one such card, they can show you any one of them.\nWhen making a suggestion, you must first ask the person to your right for any evidence. If they have none, you continue with the person on their right, and so on, until someone has evidence, or no one has any of the cards in your suggestion.\nMany times you can gain information even if you are not the person making the suggestion. Suppose, in the above example, you are the third player and have cards A and T. If someone else shows evidence to the suggester, you know that it must be weapon card L. Keeping track of suggestions and who gave evidence at each turn is an important strategy when playing the game.\nTo win the game, you must make an accusation, where you state your final guess of the murderer, weapon, and room. After stating your accusation, you check the three cards that were set aside at the start of the game \u2013 if they match your accusation, you win! Needless to say, you want to be absolutely sure of your accusation before you make it.\nHere is your problem. You are player $1$. Given a set of cards dealt to you and a history of suggestions and evidence, you need to decide how close you are to being able to make an accusation.\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$), the number of suggestions made during the game. Following this is a line containing the five cards you are dealt, all uppercase letters in the range \u2018A\u2019\u2026\u2018U\u2019. The remaining $n$ lines contain one suggestion per line. Each of these lines starts with three characters representing the suggestion (in the order person, weapon, room), followed by the responses of up to three players, beginning with the player to the right of the player making the suggestion. If a player presents no evidence, a \u2018-\u2019 (dash) is listed; otherwise an \u201cevidence character\u201d is listed. If the specific evidence card is seen by you (either because you provided it or you were the person receiving the evidence) then the evidence character identifies that card; otherwise the evidence character is \u2018*\u2019.

Only valid suggestion/response sequences appear in the input.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay a three character string identifying the murderer, the murder weapon, and the room.

However, as you gobbled up the large majority last time, your parents have invented a game to keep things fair (and to keep you occupied while they hide all the other chocolate). To keep things interesting, they have given you a rectangular piece of chocolate, which consists of little squares of both dark chocolate and white chocolate in a chessboard pattern. While you and your sister both love dark chocolate, you hate white chocolate! So, both you and your sister want as much dark chocolate as possible, while simultaneously obtaining as little white chocolate as possible. Every dark piece of chocolate you obtain gives you $1$ meaningless unit of happiness, while a white piece lowers your happiness by $1$ meaningless unit (and the same holds for your sister). Now, while you love your sister very much, there is always heavy competition between siblings, so your goal is to maximize the difference of your obtained happiness and her obtained happiness (while she tries to do the opposite, obviously). \nThe game works as follows. Your parents place a $p \\times q$-rectangle of the aforementioned mixed chocolate on a table. You are situated on the west side of the table and your sister on the south side. The side of length $p$ is parallel to the north-south line, while the side of length $q$ is parallel to the east-west line. Furthermore, the north-west square is made of dark chocolate. Then, starting with yourself, you take turns breaking off blocks of chocolate (which you can keep). You can break off any positive number of entire columns from the west side, while your sister breaks off any positive number of entire rows from the south side. You repeat this process until no more chocolate is left. Your sister is very smart and will always play the game perfectly.\nA game might proceed like this, for example: you and your sister start with a $3\\times 4$-rectangle. You decide to break off $2$ columns, obtaining $3$ dark and $3$ white chocolate squares, netting a happiness of zero. Your sister then breaks off $1$ row, obtaining $1$ dark and $1$ white squares as well, so no happiness for her either. You then take a single column, which nets you nothing again, after which your sister decides to break off one row, which nets her $1$ happiness! You then take the last piece, which makes you lose a unit of happiness, so your total score is $-1 - 1 = -2$. See the figure. (Note: the strategies used here might not be optimal.)\n-----Input-----\nGiven are two positive integers $p$ and $q$, both at most $100$, the height and width of the chocolate rectangle.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the largest possible difference (in your favour) between your net happiness and your sister\u2019s net happiness.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 2\nSample Output 1:\n2\nSample Input 2:\n2 2\nSample Output 2:\n0\n\ndef",

As they travel they may increase his strength and experience value\nin a manner to be described below.\nIn each city,  Ash can choose either to train Pikachu or let Pikachu battle the\nGym-leader (but not both).  The Gym-leader in ith city has experience E[i]. If\nPikachu enters a city i with strength S and decides to train, then this\nincreases his strength by the cube of the sum of the digits in his current\nstrength. For example, if he entered a city with a strength of 12, then\ntraining will increase his strength to 12 + (1+2)3 = 39.  On the other hand,\nif he enters city i with strength S and battles the Gym-leader, then this\nincreases his experience value XV by S*E[i].\nAsh wants your help to find out the maximum XV that Pikachu can attain \nat the end of his journey.\n-----Input-----\n- The first line contains two space separated integers, N and Sin, which are the number of cities, and the initial strength, respectively.\n- The second line contains N space separated integers, which correspond to E[1], E[2],..., E[N].\n-----Output-----\n- A single integer which is the maximum XV that Pikachu can attain.\n-----Constraints-----\nFor all test cases you may assume that: \n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 5000\n- 0 \u2264 Sin \u2264 109\n- 0 \u2264 E[i] \u2264 104\nSubtask 1: For 10% of the score,\n- N \u2264 20 and Sin = 1\nSubtask 2: For further 40% of the score,\n- E[i] = k for all i\ni.e. E[i] is some constant k, for all i\nSubtask 3: For further 50% of the score,\n- \nNo further constraints.\n-----Example-----\nInput 1:\n2 12\n5 10\nOutput 1:\n390\n-----Explanation 1-----\nSuppose Pikachu trains in the first city, his strength will increase to 39, because as explained above, 12 + (1+2)3 = 39. If he battles in the first city, his XV will increase by (12*5) = 60.\nIf Pikachu trains in the first city, and then battles in the second city, his XV will increase by 39*10 = 390. So, the final XV will be 0+390 = 390. You can check that you cannot do better than this. Hence the answer is 390.\nInput 2:\n4 1\n100 1 6 2\nOutput 2:\n120\n-----Explanation 2-----\nPikachu battles in the first city, trains in the second and third, and then battles in the fourth city. So his strength going into each of the four cities is (1, 1, 2, 10). And so he gains 1*100 XV from the first city and 10*2 XV from the fourth city. This gets him a total of 120 XV, and you can verify that nothing better can be done.\nNote:\nYou may download the problem statements PDF and test cases zipped files here: http://pd.codechef.com/com/inoi/problems.zip.

They all have different cutting speeds, cutting times and recharge times, not to mention different prices!\nAccording to the advertisement, a robotic lawnmover will spend all its time either cutting the lawn or recharging its battery.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:The Birthday Paradox is the name given to the surprising fact that if there are just $23$ people in a group, there is a greater than $50\\% $ chance that a pair of them share the same birthday. The underlying assumptions for this are that all birthdays are equally likely (which isn\u2019t quite true), the year has exactly $365$ days (which also isn\u2019t true), and the people in the group are uniformly randomly selected (which is a somewhat strange premise). For this problem, we\u2019ll accept these assumptions.\nConsider what we might observe if we randomly select groups of $P=10$ people. Once we have chosen a group, we break them up into subgroups based on shared birthdays. Among many other possibilities, we might observe the following distributions of shared birthdays:\n - all $10$ have different birthdays, or\n - all $10$ have the same birthday, or\n - $3$ people have the same birthday, $2$ other people have the same birthday (on a different day), and the remaining $5$ all have different birthdays.\nOf course, these distributions have different probabilities of occurring.\nYour job is to calculate this probability for a given distribution of people sharing birthdays. That is, if there are $P$ people in a group, how probable is the given distribution of shared birthdays (among all possible distributions for $P$ people chosen uniformly at random)?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line gives a number $n$ where $1 \\le n \\le 365$. The second line contain integers $c_1$ through $c_ n$, where $1 \\le c_ i \\le 100$ for all $c_ i$. The value $c_ i$ represents the number of people who share a certain birthday (and whose birthday is distinct from the birthdays of everyone else in the group).\n-----Output-----\nCompute the probability $b$ of observing a group of people with the given distribution of shared birthdays. Since $b$ may be quite small, output instead $\\log _{10}(b)$. Your submission\u2019s answer is considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$ from the judge\u2019s answer.\n-----Explanations-----\nThe first sample case shows $P=2$ people with distinct birthdays. The probability of this occurring is $b = 364/365 \\approx 0.9972602740$, and $\\log _{10}(b) \\approx -0.001191480807419$.\nThe second sample case represents the third example in the list given earlier with $P=10$ people. In this case, the probability is $b \\approx 0.0000489086$, and $\\log _{10}(b) \\approx -4.310614508857128$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2\n1 1\nSample Output:\n-0.001191480807419\n\ndef",

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Matryoshkas are sets of traditional Russian wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside the other. A matryoshka doll can be opened to reveal a smaller figure of the same sort inside, which has, in turn, another figure inside, and so on.The Russian Matryoshka Museum recently exhibited a collection of similarly designed matryoshka sets, differing only in the number of nested dolls in each set. Unfortunately, some over-zealous (and obviously unsupervised) children separated these sets, placing all the individual dolls in a row. There are $n$ dolls in the row, each with an integer size. You need to reassemble the matryoshka sets, knowing neither the number of sets nor the number of dolls in each set. You know only that every complete set consists of dolls with consecutive sizes from $1$ to some number $m$, which may vary between the different sets. \nWhen reassembling the sets, you must follow these rules:\n - You can put a doll or a nested group of dolls only inside a larger doll.\n - You can combine two groups of dolls only if they are adjacent in the row.\n - Once a doll becomes a member of a group, it cannot be transferred to another group or permanently separated from the group. It can be temporarily separated only when combining two groups.\nYour time is valuable, and you want to do this reassembly process as quickly as possible. The only time-consuming part of this task is opening and subsequently closing a doll, so you want to minimize how often you do this. For example, the minimum number of openings (and subsequent closings) when combining group [1, 2, 6] with the group [4] is two, since you have to open the dolls with sizes 6 and 4. When combining group [1, 2, 5] with the group [3, 4], you need to perform three openings.\nWrite a program to calculate the minimum number of openings required to combine all disassembled matryoshka sets.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 500$) representing the number of individual dolls in the row. The second line contains $n$ positive integers specifying the sizes of the dolls in the order they appear in the row. Each size is between $1$ and $500$ inclusive.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the minimum number of openings required when reassembling the matryoshka sets.
