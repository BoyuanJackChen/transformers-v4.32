In other words, in one move the robot can go from the point $(x, y)$ to the point ($x + 1, y$) or to the point $(x, y + 1)$.\nAs we say above, the robot wants to collect all $n$ packages (in arbitrary order). He wants to do it with the minimum possible number of moves. If there are several possible traversals, the robot wants to choose the lexicographically smallest path.\nThe string $s$ of length $n$ is lexicographically less than the string $t$ of length $n$ if there is some index $1 \\le j \\le n$ that for all $i$ from $1$ to $j-1$ $s_i = t_i$ and $s_j < t_j$. It is the standard comparison of string, like in a dictionary. Most programming languages compare strings in this way.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then test cases follow.\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of packages.\nThe next $n$ lines contain descriptions of packages. The $i$-th package is given as two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($0 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 1000$) \u2014 the $x$-coordinate of the package and the $y$-coordinate of the package.\nIt is guaranteed that there are no two packages at the same point. It is also guaranteed that the point $(0, 0)$ doesn't contain a package.\nThe sum of all values $n$ over test cases in the test doesn't exceed $1000$.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answer for each test case.\nIf it is impossible to collect all $n$ packages in some order starting from ($0,0$), print \"NO\" on the first line.\nOtherwise, print \"YES\" in the first line. Then print the shortest path \u2014 a string consisting of characters 'R' and 'U'. Among all such paths choose the lexicographically smallest path.\nNote that in this problem \"YES\" and \"NO\" can be only uppercase words, i.e. \"Yes\", \"no\" and \"YeS\" are not acceptable.\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5\n1 3\n1 2\n3 3\n5 5\n4 3\n2\n1 0\n0 1\n1\n4 3\nOutput\nYES\nRUUURRRRUU\nNO\nYES\nRRRRUUU\n-----Note-----\nFor the first test case in the example the optimal path RUUURRRRUU is shown below:  [Image]\n\ndef",

If the left border of the platform is $(x, y)$ then the right border is $(x + k, y)$ and all points between borders (including borders) belong to the platform.\nNote that platforms can share common points (overlap) and it is not necessary to place both platforms on the same $y$-coordinate.\nWhen you place both platforms on a plane, all points start falling down decreasing their $y$-coordinate. If a point collides with some platform at some moment, the point stops and is saved.

You are also given a positive integer $x$.\nYou are also given $q$ queries. The $j$-th query consists of one integer $y_j$ and means that you have to append one element $y_j$ to the array. The array length increases by $1$ after a query.\nIn one move, you can choose any index $i$ and set $a_i := a_i + x$ or $a_i := a_i - x$ (i.e. increase or decrease any element of the array by $x$). The only restriction is that $a_i$ cannot become negative. Since initially the array is empty, you can perform moves only after the first query.\nYou have to maximize the MEX (minimum excluded) of the array if you can perform any number of such operations (you can even perform the operation multiple times with one element).\nYou have to find the answer after each of $q$ queries (i.e. the $j$-th answer corresponds to the array of length $j$).\nOperations are discarded before each query.

After the second query, the array is $a=[0, 1]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $2$.  After the third query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $3$.  After the fourth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $3$ (you can't make it greater with operations).  After the fifth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0]$: you can perform $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 3$. The array changes to be $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]$. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to $4$.  After the sixth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0]$: you can perform $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$. The array changes to be $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0]$. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to $4$.  After the seventh query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 10]$. You can perform the following operations:   $a[3] := a[3] + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5$,  $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$,  $a[5] := a[5] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$,  $a[5] := a[5] + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6$,  $a[6] := a[6] - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$,  $a[6] := a[6] - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4$.
