They wholeheartedly agree with the main message of the conference and they are delighted with all the new things they learn about brackets.\nOne of these things is a bracket sequence. If you want to do a computation with $+$ and $\\times $, you usually write it like so:\\[ (2 \\times (2 + 1 + 0 + 1) \\times 1) + 3 + 2. \\]\nThe brackets are only used to group multiplications and additions together. This means that you can remove all the operators, as long as you remember that addition is used for numbers outside any parentheses! A bracket sequence can then be shortened to\\[ (\\; 2 \\; ( \\; 2 \\; 1 \\; 0 \\; 1 \\; ) \\; 1 \\; ) \\; 3 \\; 2. \\]\nThat is much better, because it saves on writing all those operators. Reading bracket sequences is easy, too. Suppose you have the following bracket sequence\\[ 5 \\; 2 \\; (\\; 3 \\; 1 \\; (\\; 2 \\; 2 \\; ) \\; ( \\; 3 \\; 3 \\; ) \\; 1 \\; ). \\]\nYou start with addition, so this is the same as the following:\\[ 5 + 2 + (\\; 3 \\; 1 \\; (\\; 2 \\; 2 \\; ) \\; ( \\; 3 \\; 3 \\; ) \\; 1 \\; ). \\]\nYou know the parentheses group a multiplication, so this is equal to\\[ 5 + 2 + (3 \\times 1 \\times (\\; 2 \\; 2 \\; ) \\times ( \\; 3 \\; 3 \\; ) \\times 1). \\]\nThen there is another level of parentheses: that groups an operation within a multiplication, so the operation must be addition.\\[ 5 + 2 + (3 \\times 1 \\times (2 + 2 ) \\times (3 + 3) \\times 1 ) = 5 + 2 + (3 \\times 1 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times 1) = 5+2 + 72 = 79. \\]\nSince bracket sequences are so much easier than normal expressions with operators, it should be easy to evaluate some big ones. We will even allow you to write a program to do it for you.\nNote that $(\\; )$ is not a valid bracket sequence, nor a subsequence of any valid bracket sequence.\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing a single integer $1\\leq n\\leq 3\\cdot 10^5$.\n - One line consisting of $n$ tokens, each being either (, ), or an integer $0\\leq x < 10^9+7$.

Nothing\u2019s actually been damaged.\u201d responded Robert Lackey, the chief accountant.\nBoth were staring up at the large counter suspended above the factory floor, a counter that had faithfully recorded the number of widgets that had come off the assembly line since the factory was opened. But someone had changed the number being displayed so that it formed...\n\u201cIt\u2019s a palindrome.\u201d said Lackey. \u201cIt reads the same forwards as backwards.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Diddly, \u201cis why our security guards didn\u2019t catch the vandals during their regular sweeps. It must have taken them hours to click forward to this new number, one step at a time.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d replied Lackey. \u201cAlthough we only advance the rightmost digit each time a new widget is built, it\u2019s possible to spin any of the digits. With a little planning, this might have taken only a few seconds.\u201d\n-----Description-----\nConsider a digital counter consisting of $k$ wheels, each showing a digit from 0 to 9. Each wheel is mounted so that it can advance to the next digit in a single step, e.g., from 3 to 4, or from 8 to 9.\nIt is also possible to advance from digit 9 to digit 0. However, when this happens, the wheel on its immediate left will also advance to the next digit automatically. This can have a cascade effect on multiple wheels to the left, but they all happen in a single step.\nGiven the current setting of the counter, find the smallest number of steps until one can reach a palindrome. The palindrome must respect leading zeros, e.g., 0011 is not a palindrome.\nFor example, for input 610, it takes four steps. This can be done by incrementing the 6 wheel four times, resulting in 010.\n-----Input-----\nInput will consist of single line containing an integer of $1$ to $40$ digits. The number of digits in the input is the number of wheels on the counter. Numbers may contain leading zeros.\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single line of output containing one integer, the minimum number of wheel advances required to produce a palindrome.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n0\nSample Output 1:\n0\nSample Input 2:\n009990001\nSample Output 2:\n3\nSample Input 3:\n29998\nSample Output 3:\n5\nSample Input 4:\n610\nSample Output 4:\n4\nSample Input 5:\n981\nSample Output 5:\n2\n\ndef",

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Every modern car has an odometer. It measures how far the car has traveled, and is used, among other things, to decide when to service a car. Sometimes, however, unscrupulous characters who want to sell a car might tamper with its odometer to make the car seem younger than it is. \nTommy Catkins wants to buy a used car, and has asked you to help him figure out if it has been serviced appropriately. You happen to know with certainty that the only previous owner of the car Tommy is interested in was a travelling salescat who drove at least $2000$ km and at most $20000$ km every single month. In addition, by Catland law, each car should be serviced at least every $30000$ km or $12$ months, whichever comes first, but you do not know if this has actually been done or not.\nThe service history entries indicate the approximate time the service took place, and the reading of the odometer at that time. The maximum distance the odometer can measure is $99999$ km. Upon reaching $100000$ km traveled, the odometer resets to $0$ km. In addition, the entries do not indicate exact time, only the year and month. In particular, even though you know that the car traveled between $2000$ and $20000$ km every month, you do not know how much of that distance was traveled before the service. For the purpose of the $12$ month rule, it does not matter which day during the month a service took place. For instance, it is perfectly fine if a service takes place on January 1 2017, and then the next service takes place on January 31 2018 (assuming the car did not travel more than $30000$ km during this time).\nGiven the service history entries, you must first determine whether it is possible that these are correct, or whether it can be conclusively proven that the odometer must have been tampered with. In the former case, assuming the odometer has not been tampered with, you must then determine whether or not the car has been serviced sufficiently often.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $1 \\le e \\le 500$, the number of entries in the service history.\nNext follow $e$ lines that describe the entries in the service history. Each such entry is given by three integers $y$, $m$, $o$, where $1950 \\le y \\le 2050$ and $1 \\le m \\le 12$ is the year and month of the service (respectively), and $0 \\le o \\le 99999$ is the reading of the odometer for that entry. The service entries are given in chronological order from oldest to most recent. The first service entry represents the purchase of the car when it was brand new and has $o=0$ (but the previous owner may still have travelled some or all of the distance for that month prior to buying the car). There may be multiple service entries in the same month (but they are still given in chronological order).\n-----Output-----\nIf it can be conclusively proven that the odometer must have been tampered with, output \u201ctampered odometer\u201d. Otherwise, if, assuming the odometer was not tampered with, the car can not have been serviced often enough, output \u201cinsufficient service\u201d.

E.g., in our efforts to understand the genome we investigate the structure of DNA strings. In data compression we are interested in finding repetitions, so the data can be represented more efficiently with pointers. Another plausible example arises from the area of artificial intelligence, as how to interpret information given to you in a language you do not know. The natural thing to do in order to decode the information message would be to look for repetitions in it. So if the SETI project (the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) ever get a signal in the H21-spectra, we need to know how to decompose it.\nOne way of capturing the redundancy of a string is to find its factoring. If two or more identical substrings $A$ follow each other in a string $S$, we can represent this aprt of $S$ as the substring $A$, enclosed by parentheses, raised to the power of the number of repetitions. E.g., the string $DOODOO$ can be factored as $(DOO)^2$, but also as $(D(O)^2)^2$. Naturally, the latter factoring is considered better since it cannot be factored any further. We say that a factoring is irreducible if it does not contain any consecutive repetition of a substring. A string may have several irreducible factorings, as seen by the example string $POPPOP$. It can be factored as $(POP)^2$, as well as $PO(P)^2OP$. The first factoring has a shorter representation and motivates the following definition. The weigh of a factoring equals the number of characters in it, excluding the parentheses and the exponents. Thus the weight of $(POP)^2$ is $3$, whereas $PO(P)^2OP$ has weight $5$. A maximal facotring is a factoring with the smallest possible weight. It should be clear that a maximal factoring is always an irreducible one, but there may still be several maximal factorings. E.g.,\u00a0the string $ABABA$ has two maximal factorings $(AB)^2A$ and $A(BA)^2$.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line, containing a string of at least one, but at most $200$ characters from the capital alphabet A-Z.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the weight of a maximal factoring of the input string.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nPRATTATTATTIC\nSample Output 1:\n6\nSample Input 2:\nGGGGGGGGG\nSample Output 2:\n1\nSample Input 3:\nPRIME\nSample Output 3:\n5\nSample Input 4:\nBABBABABBABBA\nSample Output 4:\n6\n\ndef",

The reason is that each of them has already mastered exactly one ball trick \u2013 either the Triple Spin, or the Power Charge. For convenience, we call the former trick 1 and the latter trick 2. These two tricks are extremely effective in attack.\nBesides mastering such powerful trick, each of them also knows how to defend against exactly one ball trick. Therefore, one of their popular training routines is to let two players play against each other, one using a trick and the other trying to defend against it. We call this a move. The one who uses a trick is called an attacker, and the other is called a defender.\nRB\u2019s team can perform sequences of moves. To state it more concisely, we use the notation $(\\text {Attacker}, \\text {Defender})$ to represent a move. Suppose the current move is $(\\texttt{A}, \\texttt{B})$. A performs the only trick he knows.\n - If A attacks successfully (i.e., B fails to defend), the next move will normally be $(\\texttt{A}, \\texttt{C})$ for some other player C.\n - However, if it is the third consecutive time A attacks successfully, A will have to take a rest for the next two moves and the next move will be $(\\texttt{C}, \\texttt{D})$ for some other players C and D.\n - If A fails (i.e., B defends successfully), the next move will be $(\\texttt{B}, \\texttt{C})$ for some other player C.\nNote that in all cases, A, B, C, and D must be pairwise distinct players. In addition, C and D must not be at rest for the next move.\nToday, RB inspects the team training. He is interested in sequences of moves of length exactly $N$. How many different sequences of moves of length $N$ are there? Two sequences of moves\\[ ((\\mathrm{ATK}_1, \\mathrm{DEF}_1), (\\mathrm{ATK}_2, \\mathrm{DEF}_2), \\ldots, (\\mathrm{ATK}_ N, \\mathrm{DEF}_ N)) \\]\nand\\[ ((\\mathrm{ATK}_1^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_1^{'}), (\\mathrm{ATK}_2^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_2^{'}), \\ldots, (\\mathrm{ATK}_ N^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_ N^{'})) \\]\nare considered different if and only if for some $i$, $\\mathrm{ATK}_ i \\neq \\mathrm{ATK}_ i^{'}$ or $\\mathrm{DEF}_ i \\neq \\mathrm{DEF}_ i^{'}$.\nSince the number may be too large, output it modulo $1000000007$ ($10^9 + 7$).\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input consists of five non-negative integers, $a_{11}$, $a_{12}$, $a_{21}$, $a_{22}$, and $N$. $a_{ij}$ denotes the number of players in RB\u2019s team who knows how to perform skill $i$ and how to defend against skill $j$.\nFor all test cases, $1 \\leq a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{21} + a_{22} \\leq 5000$, $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{18}$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of length-$N$ sequences of moves, modulo $1000000007$.\n-----Explanation-----\nFor Sample case 1, let $A$, $B$, $C$ be the players.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Harry the Hamster lives in a giant hamster cage. Inside the cage there is a set of $n$ plastic balls connected by unidirectional hamster tubes of varying lengths. Harry is currently in ball $s$ and his bed is in ball $t$.\nBeing a simple hamster, the hemispheres of Harry\u2019s brain are not so great at communicating with each other and have a mind of their own. Harry\u2019s left hemisphere, usually being active when Harry is in the hamster wheel, likes running for as long as possible. Harry\u2019s right hemisphere, rarely active at all, would like to go to sleep as soon as possible. Together, Harry\u2019s hemispheres will be navigating Harry through the maze of tubes, in each ball deciding which of the outgoing tubes to follow.\nHarry\u2019s hemispheres get really tired after making a decision and then need to rest a bit, so they cannot make two decisions in a row. Thus, they make decisions on which tube to take in alternating turns, with the left hemisphere going first. So starting in ball $s$, Harry\u2019s left hemisphere will decide on a tube to follow, ending in some ball $u$, where Harry\u2019s left hemisphere will rest and Harry\u2019s right hemisphere will pick an outgoing tube, et cetera.\nCounterintuitively, the hemispheres are familiar with the entire hamster cage and can plan arbitrarily far ahead. Assuming both hemispheres make optimal decisions, how long will it take for Harry to reach his bed? It is guaranteed that each ball has at least one outgoing tube, except the ball containing Harry\u2019s bed which has none (there Harry will rest easily). There are no tubes connecting a ball to itself, but there may be multiple tubes going from one ball to another.\n-----Input-----\n - On the first line are four space-separated integers: the number of plastic balls $1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, the number of tubes $0 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, and the locations of Harry and his bed $0 \\leq s, t < n$.\n - Then $m$ lines follow, each containing three space-separated integers describing a single tube: the ball in which the tube starts $0 \\leq a_ i < n$, in which it ends $0 \\leq b_ i < n$ and the time it takes to traverse $1 \\leq w_ i \\leq 10^4$. Note that each tube can only be traversed in one direction.\n-----Output-----\nPrint the time it takes for Harry to reach his bed, or the string infinity if Harry is doomed to roam the tubes forever.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 5 0 3\n0 1 1\n1 2 2\n2 0 4\n2 3 1\n2 3 3\nSample Output 1:\n11\nSample Input 2:\n5 5 0 4\n0 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 0 1\n2 4 1\nSample Output 2:\ninfinity\nSample Input 3:\n2 1 0 1\n0 1 2\nSample Output 3:\n2\nSample Input 4:\n3 3 1 2\n0 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 2 1\nSample Output 4:\ninfinity\n\ndef",

Timmy has two conditions when playing his own game:\n - Balls of certain colors may not be next to each other\n - One particular sequence of colors which Timmy likes most must appear as many times as possible\nCan you compute the total number of different ways in which Timmy can arrange his balls?\nFor instance, suppose Timmy has $2$ red, $1$ yellow, $2$ green, and $1$ blue ball(s).

Everyone had a wonderful dinner, and now it\u2019s time to eat the cake. There are $n$ candles on the cake. John wants to divide the cake into $n$ pieces so that each piece has exactly one candle on it, and there are no left-over pieces. For that, he made $m$ cuts across the cake. Could you help check if John\u2019s cuts successfully divide the candles on the cake?\nFormally, the cake is a circle of radius $r$ centered at $(0, 0)$. The candles are $n$ distinct points located strictly inside the circle. Each cut is a straight line $ax + by + c = 0$, described by three coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n-----Input-----\nInput starts with three integers $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$), $m$ ($1 \\leq m \\leq 15$), and $r$ ($1 \\leq r \\leq 100$) on the first line.\nThe next $n$ lines give the locations of the candles. Each line has two integers $x$ and $y$ giving the coordinates of one candle ($0 \\leq \\sqrt {x^2 + y^2} < r$).\nThe next $m$ lines give the coefficients of the cutting lines. Each line has three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($0 \\leq |a|, |b| \\leq 100, 0 \\leq |c| \\leq 20000$) describing a line of the form $ax + by + c = 0$. The values $a$ and $b$ are not both zero.\nAll candles and lines are distinct. No candle is on a cut line. No line is completely outside or tangent to the cake. The input guarantees that the number of cake pieces remains the same if any cut line is shifted by at most $10^{-4}$ in any direction. The input also guarantees that each candle remains in the interior of the same piece of cake if its position is shifted by at most $10^{-4}$ in any direction.\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u201cyes\u201d if John\u2019s cuts successfully divide the cake so that each piece he obtains has exactly one candle on it.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:The term \u201cHarvard architecture\u201d applies to a computer that has physically separate memories for instructions and data. The term originated with the Harvard Mark I computer, delivered by IBM in 1944, which used paper tape for instructions and relays for data. \nSome modern microcontrollers use the Harvard architecture \u2013 but not paper tape and relays! Data memory is organized in banks, each containing the same number of data items. Each data-referencing instruction has a byte offset $f$ to a bank, and a bit $a$ that is used to select the bank to be referenced. If $a$ is $0$, then bank $0$ is referenced. If $a$ is $1$, then the value in a bank select register (BSR) identifies the bank to be used. Assume each instruction takes the same time to execute, and there is an instruction that can set the BSR\u2019s value.\nFor example, suppose there are $4$ banks of $8$ bytes each. To access location $5$, either use a single instruction with $a = 0$ and $f = 5$, or set the BSR to $0$ in one instruction and then use an instruction with $a = 1$ and $f = 5$. The first approach is faster since it does not require setting the BSR.\nNow suppose (with the same memory) the location to access is $20$. Only one approach will work here: execute an instruction that sets the BSR to $2$ (unless the BSR already has the value $2$) and then use an instruction with $a = 1$ and $f = 4$.\nA program is a sequence of operations. Each operation is either\n - a variable reference, written as V$i$, where $i$ is a positive integer, or\n - a repetition, written as R$n$ <program> E, where $n$ is a positive integer and <program> is an arbitrary program. This operation is equivalent to $n$ sequential occurrences of <program>.\nYour problem is to determine the minimum running time of programs. In particular, given the number and size of the memory banks and a program to be executed, find the minimum number of instructions (which reference memory location and possibly set the BSR) that must be executed to run the program. To do this you must identify a mapping of variables to memory banks that yields the smallest execution time, and report that execution time \u2013 that is, the number of memory references and BSR register settings required. The BSR\u2019s value is initially undefined, and changes only when an instruction explicitly sets its value.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $b$ and $s$, where $1 \\le b \\le 13$ is the number of memory banks and $1 \\le s \\le 13$ is the number of variables that can be stored in each memory bank. The second line contains a non-empty program with at most $1000$ space-separated elements (each R$n$, V$i$, and E counts as one element).\nYou may assume the following:\n - In a repetition R$n$, the number of repetitions satisfies $1 \\le n \\le 10^6$.\n - In a loop operation R$n$ <program> E, the loop body <program> is not empty.\n - In a variable reference V$i$, the variable index satisfies $1 \\le i \\le \\min (b \\cdot s, 13)$.\n - The total number of variable references performed by an execution of the program is at most $10^{12}$.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the minimum number of instructions that must be executed to complete the program.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 2\nV1 V2 V1 V1 V2\nSample Output 1:\n5\nSample Input 2:\n2 1\nV1 V2 V1 V1 V2\nSample Output 2:\n6\nSample Input 3:\n1 2\nR10 V1 V2 V1 E\nSample Output 3:\n30\n\ndef",

You wish to minimize the expected amount of rain that would fall on you. To reach the bus you must get to the bus stop within $t$ seconds from now. You have timed your walking speed to be exactly $1 \\frac{m}{s}$.\nTo complicate matters, some parts of the walk to the bus are covered by roofs where it might be beneficial to make shorts breaks whilst waiting for the worst rain to pass.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:You are the owner of IKEA, and you need to order a large number of bolts $B$. There is a single bolt manufacturer, but there are multiple companies reselling these bolts in packs (e.g. boxes, pallets). These companies form a directed chain, where each company buys packs from the previous company and combines these into new packs (with, of course, the logo of the company displayed brilliantly).\nAt first glance, it might seem that these intermediate companies offer no advantage, as they just repack the packs of the previous company into larger packs. However, every company has their own target audience, so they want to sell packs with a specific amount of bolts. Because every company only uses the packs of the previous company, it might not be possible to create a pack that has the exact number of bolts specified. Instead, if a company wants to create a pack which is guaranteed to contain $X$ bolts, it bundles various packs from the previous company where the displayed amount of bolts on these packs sums to no less than $X$. If there are multiple such combinations it picks any from those whose displayed sum is minimal. For a better understanding, see the example below. Note that individual companies have no knowledge of the supply chain other than the pack sizes the previous company offers them.\nYou realise you can take advantage of this: when a company specifies that a pack has a certain number of bolts, it might in practice contain more! Therefore you start a quest of figuring out which pack has the lowest advertised amount, while still containing at least the number of bolts you need. Thanks to your business relations, you can freely choose the company to buy a pack from, including the manufacturer.\nExplanation of first sample\nSuppose that we would like to buy $B=310$ bolts, and that there are three companies. The manufacturer (company one) sells packs of $40$ and $65$ bolts. Company two sells packs of $100$ and $150$ bolts. It cannot get these exact amounts from company one, and instead composes them as $100 \\leq 40+65$ and $150 \\leq 40+40+40+40$.\nNext comes company three, offering packs of $300$ and $320$ bolts. It can assemble its $300$-pack using three $100$-packs (which we know actually contains $105+105+105 = 315$ bolts) or using two $150$-packs (which we know actually contains $160+160 = 320$ bolts). However, for company three either combination is fine, so you do not know how many bolts a pack actually contains. In this case you assume the worst, i.e. that this pack contains $315$ bolts.\nFor its second pack of $320$ bolts, company three uses $100+100+150 \\geq 320$ (which we know really contains $105+105+160=370$ bolts). There are other combinations adding up to more than $320$, but none achieve the minimum of $350$, so we know company three picks that combination.\nNote in particular, that company three does not know that the $150$-packs of company two actually contain $160$ bolts (otherwise it could compose its $320$-pack out of two of these). It only knows the amounts advertised by company two.\nThe packet of size $300$ sold by company three is the smallest advertised packet that contains at least $B=310$ bolts, so this is the packet we should buy. \nPack one\nPack two \nAdvertised amount\nReal amount\nAdvertised amount\nReal amount\nCompany one\n$40$\n$40$\n$65$\n$65$\nCompany two\n$100$\n$105$\n$150$\n$160$\nCompany three\n$300$\n$315$ or $320$\n$320$\n$370$\n-----Input-----\n - The first line of the input contains an integer $1 \\leq B \\leq 10^3$ giving the number of bolts that you need.\n - The second line of the input contains an integer $1 \\leq k \\leq 10$ giving the number of companies.\n - The next $k$ lines each describe a company.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Your friend just bought a new programmable robot and has asked for your help. The robot operates in a 2D grid that may contain obstacles. The environment has a known start location and a known goal location. The robot is controlled with a string consisting of commands L, R, U, and D, which respectively instruct the robot to move one square to the left, right, up or down in the grid. The robot will ignore a command (but continue with future commands) if the command would cause it to leave the grid or to run into an obstacle. If the robot were to reach the goal position, it immediately stops its program with success (even if further commands exist).\nYour friend has already programmed the robot with a command string, but the problem is that your friend is not a very good programmer, and so it may be that the commands do not lead the robot successfully to the goal. You would like to fix the string so that the robot will reach the goal, but you do not want your friend to feel bad, so you are hoping to make as few changes to the program as are needed. A single change consists either of deleting an arbitrary character of the command string, or inserting an arbitrary command anywhere within the string.\nAs an example, if we consider Sample Input\u00a01, we see that your friend\u2019s command string of DRRDD does not succeed. The initial D moves the robot one spot down. From there, the R (and the subsequent R) are ignored because of the obstacle to the robot\u2019s right. The subsequent D moves the robot down once again and the final D is ignored. However, by deleting the initial D, we can rely on the command string RRDD which does successfully lead the robot to the goal.\nIf we consider Sample Input\u00a02, we find that your friend\u2019s original command string LDLDLLDR is flawed. However, if we insert the single command U after the fifth command, the resulting string LDLDLULDR successfully guides the robot to the goal. It starts by moving left-down-left; the next down command is ignored because the robot is not allowed to leave the grid. The subsequent left-up-left completes the path to the goal (and the final DR commands are ignored as the robot stops immediately upon reaching the goal).\nWith Sample Input\u00a03, your friend\u2019s command string can be corrected with two changes, for example with the new command ULDLDLLDLR (although this is not the only way to use two changes to produce a valid sequence).\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains the two integers $H$ and $W$ that respectively define the height and width of the grid such that $1 \\le H, W \\le 50$. The next $H$ lines each has $W$ characters, describing the corresponding row of the grid, such that the character \u2019S\u2019 designates the starting location, \u2019G\u2019 designates the goal location, \u2019#\u2019 designates an obstacle, and \u2019.\u2019 designates an empty location. There will always be precisely one \u2019S\u2019 and one \u2019G\u2019 in the grid, and there will always exist an unobstructed path from the start position to the goal position. The final line of the input contains your friend\u2019s original command string consisting of between $1$ and $50$ characters, inclusive.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer indicating the minimum number of changes that are needed to fix the program.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\nS..\n.#.\n..G\nDRRDD\nSample Output 1:\n1\nSample Input 2:\n3 7\n.......\n.G.#.S.\n.......\nLDLDLLDR\nSample Output 2:\n1\nSample Input 3:\n3 7\n.#.....\n.G.##S.\n.......\nLDLDLLDR\nSample Output 3:\n2\n\ndef",

MPS assumes all positions are discrete points on a regular two-dimensional grid. Within MPS, a position is represented by a pair of integers $(X,Y)$.\nTo determine its position, an MPS receiver first measures its distance to a number of beacons. Beacons have known, fixed locations. MPS signals propagate only along the $X$ and $Y$ axes through the streets of the city, not diagonally through building blocks. When an MPS receiver at $(X_ R,Y_ R)$ measures its distance to a beacon at $(X_ B,Y_ B)$, it thus obtains the Manhattan distance: $|X_ R - X_ B|+|Y_ R - Y_ B|$.\nGiven the positions of a number of beacons and the Manhattan-distances between the receiver and each beacon, determine the position of the receiver.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:You are the boss of ACM (Association for Cool Machineries), an upstanding company with a single goal of world domination.\nLike all other world domination oriented villains, you dream of having a gigantic evil robot doing evil deeds. I mean, is there anyone who can resist the urge of having your own personal gigantic laser-firing robot? Thus, it is to your ultimate joy when the scientific committee of ACM told you about their success in inventing a prototype for the GL-bot (shorthand for Giant Laser Robot).\nAs a demonstration, they have placed GL-bot on a field modeled as an $N \\times N$ grid. Each cell in the grid is either empty or impassable. All cells on the borders of the grid are impassable. GL-bot is initially located on one of these empty cells.\nThe GL-bot\u2019s behavior is programmed with a string of length at most $N$. Each character in the string is either <, >, ^, or v, denoting four directions of movement. GL-bot will continuously move on the grid according to this string. The movement works as follows. GL-bot considers the characters in the string one by one, starting from the first character until the last character, and then loop back to the first character and repeat. GL-bot performs a movement depending on the character being considered (for the images below, black cells denote impassable cells, while white cells denote empty cells):\n - <: GL-bot moves to the left one step, if able.\n - >: GL-bot moves to the right one step, if able.\n - v: GL-bot moves down one step, if able.\n - ^: GL-bot moves up one step, if able.\nMore specifically, GL-bot moves one cell from its current location to the location as determined by the character. However, if the new location is impassable, the robot does not perform the move, and this movement is skipped. GL-bot then considers the next character in the program.\nThe trail of GL-bot is the (possibly infinite) sequence of (possibly non-distinct) cells of the grid that GL-bot traverses in order. The trail can be viewed to be generated as follows: initially, before GL-bot performs any movement, the trail contains one element: the initial location of GL-bot. Whenever GL-bot moves into a different cell, the new location of GL-bot is added to the trail. In particular, this implies that no two consecutive cells in the trail are the same \u2014 if the robot is unable to move in a particular direction because it was occupied by an impassable cell, the trail is not extended.\nYou giggle giddily as you watch GL-bot move. For some program and for some grid configuration, GL-bot will never stop moving, no matter how long time has passed. It can be proven that in this case, the trail will eventually end up repeating a continuous subsequence of itself. But you\u2026, you don\u2019t see such a thing. What you see is a robot that moves perpetually, as if it is sapient. Your fascination with GL-bot leaves the scientific committee worried, as GL-bot is not actually sapient yet (it just needs a few more tweaks). Thus, they attempt to convince you by showing that the movement is simply follows a pattern. If the length of the trail of the robot is finite, you should output $1$. Otherwise, let $X$ be the smallest integer such that the suffix of the trail will be a repetition of a continuous subsequence of the trail of length exactly $X$. Find $X$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a non-negative integer $3 \\leq N \\leq 200$, denoting both the dimension of the field and the maximum possible length of GL-bot\u2019s program.\nThe next line contains a non-empty string of length at most $N$, consisting only of the characters <, >, ^, and v. This string denotes GL-bot\u2019s program.\nThereafter follows $N$ lines, each consists of a string consisting of $N$ characters. Each line describes a row of the grid \u2014 the $j$-th character of the $i$-th line denotes the content of the cell located at the $i$-th row from the top and $j$-th column from the left, and is either one of these:\n - #: denotes an impassable cell.\n -.: denotes an empty cell.\n - R: denotes an empty cell on which the robot initially resides.\nIt is guaranteed that the grid will contain exactly one character R, and that the first and final rows and columns consist entirely of the character #.\n-----Output-----\nIf the robot\u2019s trail is of finite length, print a single integer $1$. Otherwise, print a single integer $X$ as described in the problem statement.Sample Data Explanation\nIn the first example, the trail of the robot is illustrated as follows:\nHence, $X=2$ in this case.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n6\n>^<^\n######\n#.#..#\n#....#\n#..R.#\n#....#\n######\nSample Output 1:\n2\nSample Input 2:\n4\nv<^>\n####\n#.R#\n#..#\n####\nSample Output 2:\n4\nSample Input 3:\n4\n<<<\n####\n#.R#\n#..#\n####\nSample Output 3:\n1\n\ndef",

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:For many people, the word \u201cPeru\u201d conjures up images of the Inca temple Machu Picchu and llamas. But for some visitors to the country, even more remarkable is the sight of fog-catching nets, or atrapanieblas, that Peru is using to harvest water from dense fogs. These nets capture tiny droplets from the fogs, and the water trickles down pipes into troughs that are used to irrigate crops and from which livestock drink. Well, not only livestock \u2014 the fog water is an ingredient in a local beer brand, too. According to The Economist, as early as the 1990s, some villages were capturing as much as $8000$ litres of water daily. Today, certain regions in Peru are capable of producing $1400$ litres per second, if the infrastructure is fully deployed.\nNow, the weather-simulation consultancy that was hired by the Peruvian government has delivered a model of the fogs that roll in from the sea each day. Everything in the model is positioned relative to an $x$-$y$ coordinate system, with the $x$-axis at ground level, running roughly parallel to the coast (just a few miles inland), and the $y$-axis oriented straight up. According to the model, there are $n$ originator fogs, $F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_ n$. When $F_ i$ rolls in for the first time on day $d_ i$, it settles into a space that intersects the $x$-$y$ plane in an axis-aligned rectangular region with left coordinate $\\ell _ i$, right coordinate $r_ i$, and height $h_ i$\u00a0\u2014 that is, the rectangular region $[\\ell _ i, r_ i] \\times [0, h_ i]$. Because of the periodic nature of the sea currents, each originator fog $F_ i$ gives rise to $m_ i$ fogs in total (including $F_ i$ itself), the $k$-th of which intersects the rectangular region $[\\ell _ i + k\\Delta x_ i, r_ i + k\\Delta x_ i] \\times [0, h_ i + k\\Delta h_ i]$ on day $d_ i + k \\Delta d_ i$, for $0 \\leq k < m_ i$ (where the \u201cchange\u201d values $\\Delta x_ i$, $\\Delta h_ i$, and $\\Delta d_ i$ are specific to $F_ i$).\nThe nets that are erected to catch the fogs are also modelled as axis-aligned rectangular regions lying in the same $x$-$y$ plane (but not necessarily with lower height\u00a0$0$, as is the case for the fogs). Since building a single rectangular net of sufficient length and height to catch all possible fogs would be prohibitively expensive, it was decided that for the best use of public money, the nets would be installed incrementally. Initially (i.e., on day\u00a0$0$), there are no nets. Each day, after all the fogs have lifted, net maintainers determine how many fogs were \u201cmissed\u201d that day\u00a0\u2013 that is, how many fogs corresponded to rectangles that were not completely contained in the region of the $x$-$y$ plane covered by nets. The workers then add rectangular net \u201cpatches\u201d of minimum total area so that the resulting array of nets would have caught all the fogs that day. The next day, the fogs roll in again, they lift, the workers add more patches (if necessary), and the cycle continues. Note that the portion of the $x$-$y$ plane covered by nets at any point in time is a union of axis-aligned rectangles, but in general does not constitute a single rectangular region.\nGiven a complete description of the $n$ originator fogs, count the total number of fogs that are missed.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer $n$ $(n \\leq 1000)$, the number of originator fogs.

You have been given the task of deciding if a number of statements are consistent under M\u00e5rten\u2019s Theorem.\nYou will be given a number of statements of the form \"$X$ is $Y$\" or \"$X$ not $Y$\", where $X$ and $Y$ are words consisting solely of the characters \u2019a\u2019-\u2019z\u2019, with a length of 1-20 characters, denoting that $X$ is or isn\u2019t equivalent to $Y$.

There seems to be only one species on the planet and they do not reproduce as animals on Earth do. Even more amazing, the genetic makeup of every single organism is identical!\nThe genetic makeup of each organism is a single sequence of nucleotides. The nucleotides come in three types, denoted by \u2018A\u2019 (Adenine), \u2018C\u2019 (Cytosine), and \u2018M\u2019 (Muamine). According to one hypothesis, evolution on this planet occurs when a new nucleotide is inserted somewhere into the genetic sequence of an existing organism. If this change is evolutionarily advantageous, then organisms with the new sequence quickly replace ones with the old sequence.\nIt was originally thought that the current species evolved this way from a single, very simple organism with a single-nucleotide genetic sequence, by way of mutations as described above. However, fossil evidence suggests that this might not have been the case. Right now, the research team you are working with is trying to validate the concept of \u201cparallel evolution\u201d \u2013 that there might actually have been two evolutionary paths evolving in the fashion described above, and eventually both paths evolved to the single species present on the planet today. Your task is to verify whether the parallel evolution hypothesis is consistent with the genetic material found in the fossil samples gathered by your team.\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with a number $n$ ($1\\le n\\le 4000$) denoting the number of nucleotide sequences found in the fossils. The second line describes the nucleotide sequence of the species currently living on the planet. Each of the next $n$ lines describes one nucleotide sequence found in the fossils.\nEach nucleotide sequence consists of a string of at least one but no more than $4000$ letters. The strings contain only upper-case letters A, C, and M. All the nucleotide sequences, including that of the currently live species, are distinct.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay an example of how the nucleotide sequences in the fossil record participate in two evolutionary paths. The example should begin with one line containing two integers $s_1$ and $s_2$, the number of nucleotide sequences in the fossil record that participate in the first path and second path, respectively. This should be followed by $s_1$ lines containing the sequences attributed to the first path, in chronological order (from the earliest), and then $s_2$ lines containing the sequences attributed to the second path, also in chronological order. If there are multiple examples, display any one of them. If it is possible that a sequence could appear in the genetic history of both species, your example should assign it to exactly one of the evolutionary paths.\nIf it is impossible for all the fossil material to come from two evolutionary paths, display the word impossible.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\nAACCMMAA\nACA\nMM\nACMAA\nAA\nA\nSample Output 1:\n1 4\nMM\nA\nAA\nACA\nACMAA\nSample Input 2:\n3\nACMA\nACM\nACA\nAMA\nSample Output 2:\nimpossible\nSample Input 3:\n1\nAM\nMA\nSample Output 3:\nimpossible\n\ndef",

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:A speedrun is a playthrough of a game with the intention to complete it as quickly as possible. When speedrunning, you usually follow a pre-planned path through the game. Along this path, there may be some places where you have to pull off a difficult technique, or trick, which may cause a delay if you fail to pull it off successfully. Luckily you can reset the game at any time: if you have made a few mistakes, you can start a new run, losing your progress but instantaneously starting over with a clean slate. You can do this as often as you like.\nThe game you are currently speedrunning has a record of $r$ seconds, which you intend to beat. You have discovered a path through the game that, in the best case, takes $n < r$ seconds. There are some tricks along the way, though: you know exactly where along the run they occur, what the probability is that you will pull them off successfully, and how many seconds you have to spend to recover if they fail.\nGiven this data, you want to find the optimal strategy for when to reset the game to minimise the expected time to set a new record. Write a program to determine what this smallest possible expected time is.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line with three integers $n$, $r$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n < r \\leq 5000$, $1 \\le m \\le 50$), where $n$ and $r$ are as described above and $m$ is the number of tricks.\n - $m$ lines, each containing three numbers describing a trick:\n - An integer $t$ ($1 \\le t < n$), the time in the route (assuming no failed tricks before) at which the trick occurs,\n - a real number $p$ ($0 < p < 1$ and $p$ has at most $6$ digits after the decimal point), the probability that the trick succeeds, and\n - an integer $d$ ($1 \\le d \\le 1000$), the number of seconds required to recover in case the trick fails.\nThe tricks are given in sorted order by $t$, and no two tricks occur at the same time $t$ in the route.\nYou may assume that, without resetting, a single playthrough has a probability of at least $1$ in $50000$ to succeed at improving the record.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the expected time you will have to play the game to set a new record, assuming an optimal strategy is used. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.Explanation of Sample Input 1\nThe record for this game is $111$ seconds, and your route takes $100$ seconds if everything goes right.\nAfter playing for $20$ seconds, there is a trick with a $50\\% $ success rate. If it succeeds, you keep playing. If it fails, you incur a $10$ second time loss: now the run will take at least $110$ seconds. It is still possible to set a record, but every other trick in the run has to be successful. It turns out to be faster on average to reset after failing the first trick.\nThus you repeat the first $20$ seconds of the game until the trick is successful: with probability $1/2$, it takes $1$ attempt; with probability $1/4$, it takes $2$ attempts; and so on. On average, you spend $40$ seconds on the first $20$ seconds of the route.\nOnce you have successfully performed the first trick, you want to finish the run no matter the result of the other tricks: it takes $80$ seconds, plus on average $1$ second loss from each of the remaining $4$ tricks. So the expected time until you set a record is $124$ seconds.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n100 111 5\n20 0.5 10\n80 0.5 2\n85 0.5 2\n90 0.5 2\n95 0.5 2\nSample Output 1:\n124\nSample Input 2:\n2 4 1\n1 0.5 5\nSample Output 2:\n3\nSample Input 3:\n10 20 3\n5 0.3 8\n6 0.8 3\n8 0.9 3\nSample Output 3:\n18.9029850746\n\ndef",

The racers compete by going down a mountain on a set of roads. As it would be dangerous to have cars speeding at each other in opposite directions, racers may only drive downhill on each road in a single direction. The endpoint of each road is called a station, and roads connect only at stations.\nA path is a sequence of roads where the ending station of one road is the starting station of the next. Each racer must choose a path to race on. The length of a path is the number of roads in it.\nThe goal of this race is to stay on the course as long as possible \u2013 that is, to find a path of maximum length. Every racer knows the full layout of the stations and roads, and will choose some path of maximal length.\nFiliberto is concerned about natural disasters (e.g., landslides) blocking off roads during the competition. If a road is blocked off, it may reduce the length of some paths of the race. This works as follows: say the road from station $u$ to station $v$ is blocked off. Then the racer will follow their path until station $u$, at which point they have to modify their path starting from station $u$, while still trying to maximize the length of their new path. As each racer knows the full map of the mountain, they will optimally re-route to maximize the length of their new path.\nTo understand the worst-case scenario, Filiberto wants to know the minimum length path that a winning racer would take if at most one of the roads is blocked off. This means that among all sets of maximum length paths that racers can choose and all possible roads that can be blocked off, what is the minimum length path that a racer may take after that road is blocked off and that path is at least as long as any other racers\u2019 path (other racers are also effected by the same blocked road)?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(2 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le m \\le \\min (n(n-1)/2, 10^6))$ \u2013 the number of stations and number of roads on the mountain. The next $m$ lines each contain two integers $u$ and $v$ $(1 \\le u,v \\le n, u \\ne v)$ representing a one-way road from station $u$ to station $v$. It is guaranteed that there is at most one road between any pair of stations and there are no loops in the road graph (i.e. the input is a directed acyclic graph).\n-----Output-----\nPrint a line with a single integer \u2013 the minimum length path that competitors can achieve if at most one of the roads is blocked off. That is, Filiberto wants to know the minimum longest time with the worst landslide location.\n-----Sample Explanation-----\nIn the second sample, every racer will start from stations number $1$ or $7$. If the road $(2, 3)$ is blocked, then all racers will have to re-route at station $2$ towards station $5$.\nIn the third sample, the minimum path that could be taken happens by blocking the first road of the only path that racers can choose. Blocking any other road results in a longer path.\nIn the last sample there is only one maximum length path, but the best option is to block the road $(4, 5)$.

Your job is to get the vehicle to another location $(xy)$ on the flats.\nThe hovercraft has a fixed ground speed $v$ miles per second and a fixed rate of rotation $w$ radians per second.

It is possible to find a path from any room to any other. \nOn the Borg ship there is also a sentry, placed there by the Borg eons ago.

More precisely, once every minute, the sentry chooses one of the neighbouring rooms with uniform probability, and walks quickly to this room. Your captain will also be spending exactly one minute in each room, and to minimise the chances that he will meet the sentry, you time his movement such that he and the sentry move at exactly the same time.

This wonderful new type of art is created by taking a wooden plank and pieces of tape of different colors. Each artwork is constructed by taking multiple pieces of tape and placing them on the plank. For each color that appears in the artwork, only a single piece of tape is used. Tapes can be placed on top of each other in which case the tape placed last obscures already placed pieces of tape with which it overlaps. \nRaelynn has decided the best way to learn is by copying Sheila, the world-famous tape artist. Unfortunately those pieces of art are under lock and key and Raelynn can see only pictures of these marvels. Since Raelynn is having trouble reverse engineering the artwork from the picture, she has hired you to create a set of instructions with which she can copy the art.\nSince Raelynn is spoiled by the ease of IKEA catalogs she requires instructions to be given in the following format: there should only be one instruction per color of tape and instructions should be given in the order they should be executed.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line of this test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$), where $n$ is the length of the tape art in inches.

A number of different dishes are available, and you can mix and match them to your heart\u2019s desire. Some of the dishes, such as dumplings and roasted potatoes, consist of pieces of roughly equal size, and you can pick an integral number of such pieces (no splitting is allowed). Refer to these as \u201cdiscrete dishes.\u201d Other dishes, such as tzatziki or mashed potatoes, are fluid and you can pick an arbitrary real-valued amount of them. Refer to this second type as \u201ccontinuous dishes.\u201d\nOf course, you like some of the dishes more than others, but how much you like a dish also depends on how much of it you have already eaten. For instance, even if you generally prefer dumplings to potatoes, you might prefer a potato over a dumpling if you have already eaten ten dumplings. To model this, each dish $i$ has an initial tastiness $t_ i$, and a rate of decay of the tastiness $\\Delta t_ i$. For discrete dishes, the tastiness you experience when eating the $n^{th}$ item of the dish is $t_ i - (n-1)\\Delta t_ i$. For continuous dishes, the tastiness you experience when eating an infinitesimal amount $d x$ grams of the dish after already having eaten $x$ grams is $(t_ i - x \\Delta t_ i) d x$. In other words, the respective total amounts of tastiness you experience when eating $N$ items of a discrete dish or $X$ grams of a continuous dish are as follows:\\begin{align*} \\sum _{n=1}^{N} (t_ i - (n-1)\\Delta t_ i) & & \\text {and} & & \\int _{0}^X (t_ i - x\\Delta t_ i) dx \\end{align*}\nFor simplicity, do not take into account that different dishes may or may not go well together, so define the total tastiness that you experience from a meal as the sum of the total tastinesses of the individual dishes in the meal (and the same goes for the weight of a meal \u2013 there are no food antiparticles in the buffet!).\nYou have spent days of painstaking research determining the numbers $t_ i$ and $\\Delta t_ i$ for each of the dishes in the buffet.

Each dish description is in one of the following two forms:\n - A description of the form \u201cD $w_ i$ $t_ i$ $\\Delta t_ i$\u201d indicates that this is a discrete dish where each item weighs $w_ i$ grams, with initial tastiness $t_ i$ and decay of tastiness $\\Delta t_ i$.\n - A description of the form \u201cC $t_ i$ $\\Delta t_ i$\u201d indicates that this is a continuous dish with initial tastiness $t_ i$ and decay of tastiness $\\Delta t_ i$.\nThe numbers $w_ i$, $t_ i$, and $\\Delta t_ i$ are integers satisfying $1 \\le w_ i \\le {10000}$ and $0 \\le t_ i, \\Delta t_ i \\le {10000}$.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the maximum possible total tastiness of a meal of weight $w$ based on the available dishes.

For instance, if you start by playing Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s song \u201cPagan Poetry\u201d, you could continue with next playing matmos\u2019 track \u201cEnigma Machine for Alan Turing\u201d since matmos contributed to Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Vespertine album (on which Pagan Poetry appears).

The ordering of the songs is important, so just because you could play song X after song Y it will not necessarily be the case that you can play song Y after song X.

Yet again, all the clocks in Petra\u2019s home show the wrong time due to a power outage that occurred while she was sleeping. This means she has to spend her day resetting all the clocks to the correct time. Now, you might not consider this a big deal. After all, how many clocks does any single household really have? Well, Petra just so happens to be a collector of clocks. She literally has hundreds of clocks \u2013 and that is just in her bedroom! Thus, it is understandable that she does not look forward to all this resetting. \nYou, as her friend, would prefer if she did not need to spend her entire day resetting all her clocks. Especially since this means she would not have any time to play with you! If only you could construct some automated way of entering the correct time into all the clocks, perhaps through some kind of computer code...\nA-ha, of course! You can write a program to determine how to set the correct time as quickly as possible!\nEach clock has a display of $4$ digits: two are used to display the hour (between 00 and 23), and two are used to display the minute (between 00 and 59). The time can be changed by selecting a digit and either decreasing or increasing by $1$. Decreasing a digit that is $0$, it is turned into $9$, and increasing a digit $9$ turns it into $0$. However, the clock can not display invalid times. This means that at any given time, the hour must be between 00 and 23 and the minute between 00 and 59.\nWrite a program that, given the original time of a clock and the current time, determines how to set the clock correctly.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists:\n - one line with the time that the clock is currently set to.\n - one line with the current time.\nEach time has the format hh:mm, where hh is a two-digit number between 00 and 23, and mm is a two-digit number between 00 and 59.\n-----Output-----\nThe first line contains the number of different times seen on the clock when setting it correctly.

The index start is the index of the character immediately after the \u2018:\u2019, and end is the index past the last header corresponding to the last bracket pair contained in this bracket pair. By taking a substring(start, end) of the new notation, you get an alternative bracket sequence describing all of the pairs of brackets contained by the brackets corresponding to the \u201cstart,end:\u201d! Since an empty pair of brackets has nothing inside, in their header, start and end will be the same.\nEach index takes up as many characters in the string as they do when they are base $10$ numbers. (For example, the index $42$ will take up $2$ characters). The indices in the new string start from $0$. All of the indices found in the alternative bracket notation string are absolute indices from the beginning of the new string.\nConsider this parenthetical statement: (())\nHere is it, in our new, alternate bracket notation: 4,8:8,8:\nIn this example, there are two sets of matching parenthesis, the outer one and the inner one. The outer one appears before the inner one, since the start bracket appears first. So, the header for the outer brackets will appear before the header for the inner bracket. The header 4,8: represents the outer bracket, while the header 8,8: represents the inner bracket. The substring from the $4$th character to $7$th character is 8,8:, which represents what is contained inside the outer bracket. Note that 5,11:11,11: could also be a legitimate alternate notation, but we want the shortest one, which is why 4,8:8,8: is the correct answer.\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case.

The change to the previous version is marked in bold.\nMarek loves dancing and he has danced a lot in the last couple of years. He has actually danced so much that he became too good in all of the traditional dances like swing, salsa, ballroom and hip-hop and now all partners he dances with can not keep up with him. Therefore he started to invent his own dances and even tries to convince other people to dance these new dances with him.\nMarek got really excited when he heard about the coming wedding of his best friend Miroslav. For a whole month he worked on a special dance for the wedding. The dance was performed by $N$ people and there were $N$ marks on the floor. There was an arrow from each mark to another mark and every mark had exactly one incoming arrow. Marek did not want anyone to stand on one place the whole time, so no arrow pointed from a mark back to the same mark.\nAt the wedding, every person first picked a mark on the floor and no 2 persons picked the same one. Then Marek played some music and every 10 seconds there was a loud signal when all dancers had to move along the arrow on the floor to another mark. The placement of the marks was such that everybody could follow the arrow to the next mark in 10 seconds without any trouble.\nA year has passed since Miroslav\u2019s wedding and another wedding is coming up. Marek would like to do a similar dance at this wedding as well. He lost all the drawings he had, but luckily he found two photos from exactly when the dance started and when it ended. Marek also remembers that the signal was triggered $K$ times during the time the song was played, so people moved $K$ times along the arrows.\nGiven the two photos, can you help Marek reconstruct the arrows on the floor so that each arrow connects two different marks? On the two photos it can be seen for every person to which position he or she moved. Marek therefore numbered the people in the first photo from $1$ to $N$ and then wrote the number of the person whose place they took in the second photo.\nMarek\u2019s time is running out, so he is interested in any placement of arrows that could produce the two photos.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $N$ and $K$, $2 \\le N \\le 10000, 1\\le K \\le 10^9$.

Installing routers at different offices may have different costs.\nHowever, some issues arise. If neither of the two offices incident to a corridor has a router, the corridor would have weak signal. If both of the two offices incident to a corridor have a router, the corridor would have conflicting signals that would cause both routers to be inaccessible from the corridor.

Consequently, for every corridor that has either weak or conflicting signal, you must additionally install a cellular hub, which provides separate wireless service (that uses cellular network and is independent of the routers).

If $f_ i = i$, that means he can paint the image numbered $f_ i$ whichever color he likes, as long as all other conditions have been met.\nMirko wants to know the number of possible ways to color Slavko\u2019s coloring book and he desperately needs your help! Calculate the number of possible ways to color the book. Given the fact that the output can be very large, print the answer modulo $1000000007$.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains positive integers $N$, $K$ ($1 \\leq N, K \\leq 1000000$).

As you are very excited about this discovery, you want to inform your fellow spies of these newfound documents by sending a message to each of them. One option is to privately message all spies within your organization, but this takes a lot of time. Fortunately, the other spies have networks of their own, so they are able to pass on your message to other spies.\nHowever, there are enemy spies in the network, who will pass along the message to the enemy organization. It is therefore vital that the enemy spies do not receive your message. Luckily, you happen to know who these traitors are, so you can avoid them.\nThere are two ways for you to send the information to other spies in the network: either by private or by public message. If you use a private message, the receiving spy knows that the message is confidential and they will not tell any other spy. If, on the other hand, you send a spy a public message, the spy will notify all other spies he/she can contact about the message. Since the message is not deemed confidential for them, these spies will in turn contact all spies they can get in contact with and so on (regardless of any messages that they received before). Since you do not want anyone else to know who the enemy spies are, you cannot tell people to contact only specific connections.\nBecause of the huge size of your spy network, you would like to minimize the number of people you personally need to tell the secret message, while ensuring that no enemy spies receive the message. Can you find out how many spies you need to message?\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of three parts:\n - The first line contains three integers, $S$, $E$ and $C$. The first integer ($1\\le S \\le 50{.}000$) denotes the total number of spies in the network (yourself not included), the second integer ($0 \\le E \\le S$) denotes the total number of enemies in the network and the third integer specifies the total number of connections ($0 \\le C \\le 10^5$) between spies in the network.\n - Then follow $C$ lines, with two integers $0\\leq S_1<S$ and $0\\leq S_2<S$ on each line, indicating that there is a connection from spy $S_1$ to spy $S_2$. These connections are not symmetric.\n - Finally, one line with $E$ integers, indicating that these spies are enemies.\nYou may assume that you can message every spy in the network directly.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with one integer indicating the minimum number of messages you need to send to other spies, counting both private and public messages.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 1 3\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n1\nSample Output 1:\n2\nSample Input 2:\n4 0 4\n0 2\n0 1\n2 1\n2 3\nSample Output 2:\n1\n\ndef",
