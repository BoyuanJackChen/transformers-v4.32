When I go from my home up the road to Queen of Hearts\u2019 Castle, my watch counts nine hours. However, if I continue down to Mad Hatter\u2019s House, my watch counts just two hours in total. Isn\u2019t that great?\n Alice: How can it be Rabbit? The path is longer and you take a shorter time to do it? How can it be?\n Rabbit: Trust me Alice! It is all recorded in my logbook. You can check it. All my trips are there...\n Alice: Rabbit, I do not think it can help me...\n Rabbit: Alice, no matter where you are, or where you want to go, or the track you choose, you\u2019ll be able to find how long it takes you.\n Alice: Really?\n Rabbit: For sure!\n\u00a0\n Poor Rabbit, poor Alice.\nWhite Rabbit is helping Alice finding a quick way home through the Rabbit\u2019s hole with his holy logbook of trips. The problem lies in the chronometer of its bizarre pocket watch (it displays the hours from zero to $12$), and the way the Rabbit counts the time with it: If a journey takes $14$ hours (real time), seeing the pointer resting above number one, he assumes it took one hour.\nGiven that the White Rabbit is telling the truth, can you help Alice finding how long the shortest path home takes, using the Rabbit\u2019s logbook of trips?\n-----Task-----\nYour task is to find the shortest real time it takes for Alice to go from her present location to the Rabbit\u2019s hole. For each trip, the White Rabbit wrote down the trip time, the number of visited locations (not necessarily distinct) and the sequence in which they were visited. That sequence defines the trip because there is at most one direct track between any two locations in the Wonderland and it takes the same time both ways. The White rabbit\u2019s logbook contains trips using all roads in Wonderland; there are no direct connections beyond those implied by the trips in the log book.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains four integers $N$, $A$, $R$ and $T$, where: $N$ is the number of distinct locations; $A$ identifies the place where Alice is located; $R$ corresponds to the Rabbit\u2019s hole location; and $T$ is the number of trips recorded in White Rabbit\u2019s logbook. All locations are identified by numbers from $1$ to $N$. Each of the next $T$ lines describes a trip logged with format $d p a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{p}$, where $d$ is the trip duration (according to White Rabbit), $p$ is the number of locations and $a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{p}$ is the sequence of visited locations.\n-----Constraints-----\n$2$\n$\\leq $\n$N$\n$\\leq $\n$200$\nNumber of locations\n$1$\n$\\leq $\n$T$\n$\\leq $\n$500$\nNumber of trips in the logbook\n$2$\n$\\leq $\n$p$\n$\\leq $\n$800$\nNumber of (possibly repeated) locations in a trip\n$1$\n$\\leq $\n$d_{ij}$\n$\\leq $\n$12$\nReal time of the direct track between $a_ i$ and $a_ j$ (if it exists)\nThere are at most $200$ direct tracks.

He appointed his advisor Wessus Waterus to try to find a way to get each town a fresh supply of water.\nThere are many springs and many towns and between each are the natural hills and valleys of Roman Britain. Wessus doesn\u2019t want to waste the Imperial coin. He has been tasked with linking each town to a spring by a series of aqueducts using as little material as possible. Water, as we know, only flows downhill so any aqueduct must go from a higher point to a lower; intervening hills, springs and towns are no problem since they can be tunnelled through and on. The only requirement is that all aqueduct components start and end on hilltops.\nAny spring must only serve one town, but the Romans are clever enough to find a way for aqueducts to pass each other. Roman engineering is excellent, but has its limits: aqueducts can only be of a limited length.\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing four integers: $n,s,t$ and $q$ where $0 < n \\le 500$ is the number of hills, $1 \\le s \\le 40$ is the number of springs, $1 \\le t \\le s$ is the number of towns and $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 3\\cdot 10^6$) is the maximum aqueduct length.\n - $N$ more lines, each giving the space-separated integers $x_ i, y_ i, h_ i$: the coordinates and height of a hill ($0 \\le |x|, |y|, h \\le 10^6$).

Then, he chooses $26$ non-empty strings $T_ a, T_ b, \\dots, T_ z$, each consisting of at least two lowercase English letters. He defines a function $f$, which converts each character $i$ to its corresponding string $T_ i$ and concatenates the results.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:You\u2019ve intercepted encrypted communications between Martian diplomats. Since Martian diplomats are often spies, you decide to decrypt the messages. While the Martians have skilled rocket tech, they lag behind in number theory considerably, which compromises their encryption protocol.\nFortunately for you, spies friendly to you have reverse engineered the Martian protocol. It turns out that the Martians are using a shift-based cipher combined with a very long one-time pad. More specifically, the decryption procedure works as follows:\nStep 1: Define the function $f(x) = (33x + 1) \\mod 2^{20}$.\nFurther define $f^1(x) = f(x)$, \u00a0$f^2(x) = f(f(x))$, \u00a0$f^3(x) = f(f(f(x)))$, and so on.\nStep 2: Create a $X$ by $X$ size grid, fill the upper left corner with $f^1(0)$, the next cell to the right with $f^2(0)$, $f^3(0)$ etc. Once the top row is filled, continue to the cell below the upper left cell, and fill with $f^{X+1}(0)$. Continue this process until all rows are filled.\nStep 3: Sum all the values in every column, and take those values mod $2^{20}$.\nStep 4: Concatenate the base-10 representations of the column sums together, to get a very long base-10 number. For instance, if you had column sums of 10 and 12 for the first and second column, the leftmost four digits of the resulting value would be 1012.\nStep 5: Convert the result of step 4 from base $10$ to base $27$. This will yield the one-time pad the Martians used.\nStep 6: For each letter $l$ of the intercepted message, shift the letter by the amount given by the corresponding digit of step 5, base $27$. \u201cShifting\u201d means to add the digit at the corresponding position of the pad to the value of the letter in the encrypted message and then to compute its remainder modulo $27$. You may assume that both the encrypted and the decrypted message consist of only uppercase English characters \u2018A\u2019 through \u2018Z\u2019 and spaces, which are assigned values $0 \\ldots 26$ (A = 0, B = 1,... Z = 25, SPACE = 26). Thus, if the encrypted message has letter \u2018D\u2019 in position $3$, and the $3^{\\text {rd}}$ base-$27$ digit of the pad is $25$, then the decrypted letter after shifting would be $3 + 25 = 1 \\mod 27$ which is \u2018B\u2019.\nStep 7: Output the decrypted message.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two positive integers, $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 10^6$), and $X$ ($1 \\le X \\le 2.5 \\cdot 10^5$).

It was one of the most memorable parade because of the serious circumstance at that time: Soviet\u2019s forces had constantly been dominated since the last 4 months, and Moscow was surrounded by Nazi under an extremely high pressure. Many soldiers joined that parade, and immediately rushed into the battle field after then. The winning against Nazi later pushed Hitler\u2019s forces very far away from Moscow and completely destroyed his Barbarossa plan\u2026\nIn order to ensure safety for the parade, Stalin gathered information about the positions of Nazi\u2019s troops.

One of our teachers told us at the final year that among all the educational institutions in life one misses his/her school days the most. And yes, I miss those days a lot.\nLet me tell you that we had a grid board in our school and it was not as banal as it looks in the picture. The board was colorful and we also had different color chalks to use on it. Can you imagine how exciting it was for me when I first saw this board? In class break we used to draw on this board and play different games, few of them I can recall.\nOne of them was like this\u2014firstly two players will mark some grid points. Then they will toss deciding who plays first. At each turn a player marks four points as $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$. Then join $(A, B)$, $(B, C)$, $(C, D)$ and $(D, A)$ to form a quadrilateral. Twice of the area of that quadrilateral is added to his score and the turn changes. (In case, if you are wondering why twice\u2014it is just to ensure that the score is always integer). A player can not draw a quadrilateral if it was drawn before. However, you can use previously used points. For example, suppose there are $5$ points on the grid, $P$, $Q$, $R$, $S$ and $T$. First player can choose, $(A, B, C, D) = (P, Q, R, S)$, but then the second player can not choose $(A, B, C, D) = (R, S, P, Q)$ because both of them depict the same quadrilateral. If both of the players play optimally to maximize their own score I wonder what could be the sum of their scores.\nSo your task is to construe this game. You are given coordinates of $N$ distinct points, if two players play the above mentioned game optimally then what is the sum of their scores?\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a positive integer $N$ ($N \\leq 700$). Hence follows $N$ coordinates of the points $(x, y)$. In case you don\u2019t know, I should say\u2014I am not from your time, I was brought here by a few scientists from future. And in my time we use huge boards so the absolute value of the coordinates can be as large as $10^6$. Just to ensure that no one can draw a degenerate quadrilateral, no three points will be collinear.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the sum of the scores.

CrowFinders has a voting system where users can upvote or downvote comments, which increases or decreases their score by $1$. This means that each comment can end up with any integer score (including negative scores). Once when Nick was browsing a heated discussion about the classification of jackdaws as crows, he found something very pleasing: a chain of comments that alternated between positive and negative scores. But a few days later, he found that the comment chain was no longer alternating. Now Nick wants to make it alternating again. \nA comment chain is alternating if the scores $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_ n$ of the comments all are non-zero, and every pair of adjacent scores $s_ i$, $s_{i+1}$ have opposite signs. In particular, a single comment with a non-zero score or even a comment chain without any comment is an alternating comment chain.\nThere are two operations Nick can do to make the comment chain alternating:\n - Create a fake account and upvote/downvote some of the comments. This increases/decreases their respective scores by $1$. Each fake account can only upvote/downvote each comment at most once, but it can vote on any subset of the comments. It takes $c$ seconds to create an account and use it to vote (regardless of how many comments are upvoted/downvoted).\n - Report one specific comment to remove it from the chain. Thinking of convincing reasons for the report takes $r$ seconds. (Nick is an excellent arguer, so once the report is filed, the comment is guaranteed to be removed.)\nNick can apply these operations in any order, any number of times. How fast can he make the comment chain alternating?\nFor example, consider Sample Input 1 below, where the scores in the comment chain are $8, 8, 2, -2$, and it takes Nick $10$ seconds to create an account and $50$ seconds to file a report for one comment. In this case it is optimal to first create $3$ fake accounts and use them to upvote the fourth comment and downvote the third, followed by reporting the first comment. This results in the scores $8, -1, 1$, which is an alternating chain. The time used for this is $80$ seconds.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line with three integers $n$, $c$, and $r$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 5\\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq c,r \\leq 10^9$), the number of comments in the chain, the time it takes to create a fake account and the time it takes to report one comment respectively.\n - One line with $n$ integers $s_1, \\ldots, s_ n$ ($-10^9 \\leq s_ i \\leq 10^9$ for all $i$), the current score of each comment in the chain.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the smallest time to make the comment chain alternating by applying the operations above.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 10 50\n8 8 2 -2\nSample Output:\n80\n\ndef",

If he doesn\u2019t get there in time, Donald might show up and take his place instead. \nDuckburg has recently started providing a very eco-friendly way of public transport: bikes. At many bike stations throughout the city, one can pick up a free bike, ride it to another bike station, and drop it there. This gives Gladstone two ways of transportion: on foot or by bike. Biking is faster, of course, but he must pick up and leave the bikes at the designated stations. Gladstone can walk or bike between any two points in a straight line.\nGladstone possesses a map of the (rectangular) center of Duckburg. His current position is on this map and so is the meeting point with Daisy. The map also contains the locations of all bike stations within the boundaries of the map.\nThere can be way more bike stations though, that are not within the boundaries of the map. Considering his luck, you can assume that the moment Gladstone walks (or bikes) off the map, he encounters a bike station if that suits him well. The bike stations not on the map can be located anywhere outside the map, they do not have to lie on integer coordinates.\nThat leaves Gladstone with the task of figuring out which route to take.

Since you are confident that you can get either party to back the plot, it does not matter which party ultimately prevails.\nThe secret committee has studied the political situation and determined that two governors will influence each other if they are friends with each other and members of the same Party. To get all the state governors on board, each month a lobbyist will do whatever it takes to get one governor to switch parties. When this happens, all the friends of the governor who are members of the same Party will also switch affiliation, as will the friends of the friends within the party, and so on. To avoid suspicion, the secret committee will alternate Orange/Purple lobbyists each month. They may start the ball rolling with either party in the first month.\nThe secret committee also knows which governors are friends with each other, that each governor is friends with at least one other governor, and that there are no isolated groups that are only friends with each other.\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of months required for all the state governors to be members of the same party.

Finally, the first season of reading is coming to its end, and the students in the book circle are going to present their fantastic books to the rest of the computer science students. However, there is a problem. To attract audience to the presentation, one of the book circle members (without mentioning any names) has promised the audience that a book circle member will sing in between each two presentations. The person who made this promise doesn\u2019t know how to sing, so he or she must have been thinking that someone else in the group could do the singing. But in fact, no one in the group wants to sing. The book circle always sticks to its promises, which means there is some singing to do. However, they have also promised to present all of the books that they have read. Someone in the group has figured out that if they minimize the number of presentations \u2013 they will minimize the number of times they have to sing, since if a student has read several books, he or she can present a bunch of them in the same presentation.

As you can imagine, demonstrating low-level ideas of your implementation is not a good way to impress your boss, so Goo instead decided to make a presentation with plenty of graphs showing filtering results. The company has a huge database of e-mails and each e-mail is marked as a spam or ham (i.e.\u00a0not spam). These e-mails were all correctly marked by people \u2013 every time someone in the company receives an e-mail, he marks it as either spam or ham and adds it to the database.\nThe success of Goo\u2019s program can be measured in a simple way. Goo ran his program on all e-mails in the database. For each message he noted if his program correctly decided whether the message was spam or ham. The messages were processed in order from the oldest to the newest one. To impress the boss, Goo wants to select e-mails from a period of time and calculate the success rate only for this period.

In reality, it is extremely rare for pirates to bury treasure; there are only a few such documented cases.\nAs it turns out, the vast majority of treasure maps are published by the Mapping Association of Plunder and Spoils (MAPS), a secretive group of people responsible for curating reports of lost or stolen treasure and then making and selling corresponding treasure maps.\nOver the years, MAPS has become increasingly creative with the structure of its treasure maps, so these maps no longer resemble a stereotypical treasure map. In fact, they no longer come in one piece; treasure hunters must assemble a map from multiple pieces before being able to use it to locate buried treasure.\nFormally, an assembled treasure map is a rectangular grid of squares, where each square indicates the rectilinear distance (sum of horizontal distance and vertical distance) to the square containing the treasure, modulo $10$.\nGiven a list of smaller rectangular map pieces, you must rearrange the pieces to reconstruct a valid rectangular map, rotating (but not flipping) the pieces as needed. Every map piece must be used exactly once in the reconstructed map, no two map pieces may overlap, and the reconstructed map must not contain any gaps.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer, $N$ ($2\\leq N\\leq 8$), indicating the number of rectangular map pieces. This is followed by a series of lines describing each map piece. The description of the $i$-th piece ($1\\leq i\\leq N$) begins with a line containing two space-separated integers, $W_ i$ and $H_ i$, giving the $i$-th piece\u2019s width and height, respectively, where $1\\leq W_ i, H_ i\\leq 10$. This is followed by $H_ i$ lines of $W_ i$ characters each, where each character represents one square of the map piece (using a digit from $0$ to $9$, inclusive). It is guaranteed that one of the map pieces contains a square corresponding to the location of the treasure.\n-----Output-----\nOutput a line containing $W$ and $H$, separated by a single space, where $W$ is the width and $H$ is the height of a valid reconstructed map (such a reconstruction will always be possible). Then output the reconstructed map as $H$ lines of $W$ characters each. (In the event that there are multiple possible maps that can be produced, it suffices to output any one of them, in any of the $4$ possible rotations.) On the following line, output $W$ hyphen (\u2018-\u2019) characters. Then output $H$ lines of $W$ characters each, where each character is a digit between $1$ and $N$, inclusive, that is the ($1$-based) index of the map piece to which the corresponding square in the reconstructed map belongs.

For example, many programs need to use \u2018libc,\u2019 which contains standard C-library functions. To keep track of these dependencies, many distributions use some sort of package manager.\nWhen a user wants to install a new package (or set of packages), a package manager takes care of the headache of tracking down which packages are required to install the desired package. Of course, those may also depend on other packages.\nFor this problem, determine an order (if one exists) that allows a given list of packages to be installed.

A potential attacker could easily pick the locks on these doors to gain access to any room of the building. This is frankly unacceptable as there are reams upon reams of priceless paper stored inside the office.\nTo appease your tenant, you offer to replace one existing door with a new high-security door that will stop any attacker. To get the most benefit from the new door, it should protect the maximum possible number of rooms in the building. That is, you need to find which existing door to replace with a secure door such that the maximum number of rooms can only be reached from outside the building through the new door.\nThe building contains $0<N<100000$ rooms which are connected by $0<M<100000$ doors. Rooms are uniquely named by the integers in the range $[0,N)$. To figure out where to install the secure door, you have a floor plan of the building. The floor plan somehow represents all of the floors in one (possibly non-planar) graph. The only way to pass from one room to another, or the outside, is by using a door.

The problem can be mitigated by adding a cache, where a node stores some resources locally and if those resources need to be used again, it can simply take them from its cache rather than asking someone else for them. \nHowever, caches have a nasty tendency to fill up, so at some point, objects must be evicted from the cache to make room for new objects. Choosing what object to remove from the cache is not easy and there are several different algorithms to choose from.\nThe marvelous Apes in Computing Machinery have come up with a fantastic new algorithm, the Introspective Caching Algorithm, named after a city of Peru. It consists of some extra hardware (a very small, precognitive monkey) which helps making decisions. Since the monkey can see into the future, she knows exactly what objects will be accessed and in what order, and using this information she will make optimal decisions on what objects to remove from the cache. Optimality here means that she will minimize the number of times an object is read into the cache.\nAll object accesses go through the cache, so every time an object is accessed, it must be inserted into the cache if it was not already there. All objects are of equal size, and no writes occur in the system, so a cached object is always valid.

Even though his previous plan of a giant dome over Stockholm to protect from too much sunlight (as well as rain and snow) has not yet been realized, he is now focusing on preempting the possible effects climate change might have on the Baltic Sea, by the elegant solution of simply removing the Baltic from the equation. \nFirst, Gunnar wants to build a floodbank connecting Denmark and Norway to separate the Baltic from the Atlantic Ocean. The floodbank will also help protect Nordic countries from rising sea levels in the ocean. Next, Gunnar installs a device that can drain the Baltic from the seafloor. The device will drain as much water as needed to the Earth\u2019s core where it will disappear forever (because that is how physics works, at least as far as Gunnar is concerned). However, depending on the placement of the device, the entire Baltic might not be completely drained \u2013 some pockets of water may remain.\nTo simplify the problem, Gunnar is approximating the map of the Baltic using a $2$-dimensional grid with $1$ meter squares. For each square on the grid, he computes the average altitude. Squares with negative altitude are covered by water, squares with non-negative altitude are dry. Altitude is given in meters above the sea level, so the sea level has altitude of exactly $0$. He disregards lakes and dry land below the sea level, as these would not change the estimate much anyway.\nWater from a square on the grid can flow to any of its $8$\u00a0neighbours, even if the two squares only share a corner. The map is surrounded by dry land, so water never flows outside of the map. Water respects gravity, so it can only flow closer to the Earth\u2019s core \u2013 either via the drainage device or to a neighbouring square with a lower water level.\nGunnar is more of an idea person than a programmer, so he has asked for your help to evaluate how much water would be drained for a given placement of the device.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $h$ and $w$, $1 \\leq h, w \\leq 500$, denoting the height and width of the map.\nThen follow $h$ lines, each containing $w$ integers.

The vast wealth he has accumulated allows him to indulge in an extravagant hobby: collecting vintage automobiles. On Sunday afternoons, Micah and his family enjoy taking long, leisurely drives in these classic cars. Because of the unusual road system in the province, they have made something of a game out of planning their weekly outings.\nMicah\u2019s province contains $n$ towns that are connected by a network of roads. Every road joins some town\u00a0$x$ to a different town\u00a0$y$, and all roads are one-way\u00a0(!) There is never more than one road from any town\u00a0$x$ to any other town\u00a0$y$ (although there may be a road going in the reverse direction), and other than the fact that roads may meet at their endpoints (towns), no two roads intersect (this is facilitated by an elaborate system of overpasses and underpasses).\nEach Sunday after lunch, Micah and his family plan and then embark on what they call a round trip. This involves first going to one of the $n$ towns (via helicopter, of course; driving there would detract from the graph theoretic purity of the entire excursion), getting into one of Micah\u2019s fine cars (also transported there by helicopter), and then driving from town to town along the various one-way roads in such a way that they always end up back at the town where they started (whereupon helicopters transport everyone/everything back home). There is one family cardinal rule: during one of these round trips, they can never drive along the same road twice. Overall, a round trip can be represented as a sequence of towns\\[ x_0 \\ \\ \\ x_1 \\ \\ \\ x_2 \\ \\ \\ \\ldots \\ \\ \\ x_{T-1} \\ \\ \\ x_ T \\]\nwhere (a)\u00a0$T \\geq 2$, (b)\u00a0$x_0 = x_ T$ is the starting town, (c)\u00a0there is a (one-way) road from $x_ i$ to $x_{i+1}$ for $0 \\leq i < T$, and (d)\u00a0no road is repeated. Note that $x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{T-1}$ are not necessarily all distinct.\nIn their endless quest for adventure, Micah and his family have decided that they never want to take the same round trip twice, so Micah has designed a simple algorithm to count exactly how many round trips are possible. It saddens them, though, when this algorithm reveals that this number is in fact finite, which means that one day they will have used up all the possible round trips. However, there is hope! From time to time, the province constructs a new road, which is very exciting because a new road may mean new round trips. Unfortunately, Micah\u2019s evil twin, Hacim (separated at birth), has recently been appointed Director of the Inter-County Paving Commission (ICPC), and he is determined to use his new power to minimize all this vexing family-oriented fun. Hacim cannot prevent the construction of new roads altogether, of course (that would eventually get him fired), but he can influence which new roads get constructed. For Hacim, \u201cfun\u201d means approving the construction of a new road that does not create any new round trips for Micah and his family. Hacim wonders how long he can continue doing this, i.e., how many new roads can be constructed without creating any new round trips. Since he is not as good as Micah at designing counting algorithms, he needs your help to figure this out.\nNote that a new road, like an existing road, can meet other roads at its endpoints, but otherwise it cannot intersect any other road.

On the other hand, the binary representation of $73$ is rather remarkable: it\u2019s $1$ one followed by $2$ zeroes, followed by $1$ one, followed by $2$ zeros, followed by $1$ one. This is an interesting pattern that we can generalize: $N$ ones, followed by $M$ zeros, followed by $N$ ones, followed by $M$ zeros, etc, ending in either $N$ ones or $M$ zeroes. For $73$, $N$ is $1$, $M$ is $2$, and there are $5$ runs of equal symbols. With $N = 2$, $M = 1$ and $4$ runs, we would have the string $110110$, which is the binary representation of $54$.\nAcknowledging Sheldon\u2019s powerful insight, let us introduce the concept of a Sheldon number: a positive integer whose binary representation matches the pattern $ABABAB\\ldots ABA$ or the pattern $ABABAB\\ldots AB$, where all the occurrences of $A$ represent a string with $N$ occurrences of the bit $1$ and where all the occurrences of $B$ represent a string with $M$ occurrences of the bit $0$, with $N > 0$ and $M > 0$. Furthermore, in the representation, there must be at least one occurrence of the string $A$ (but the number of occurrences of the string $B$ may be zero).\nMany important numbers are Sheldon numbers: $1755$, the year of the great Lisbon earthquake, $1984$, of Orwellian fame, and $2015$, the current year! Also, $21$, which Sheldon mentions, is a Sheldon number, and so is $42$, the answer given by the Deep Thought computer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.\nClearly, there is an infinite number of Sheldon numbers, but are they more dense or less dense than prime numbers?\n-----Task-----\nYour task is to write a program that, given two positive integers, computes the number of Sheldon numbers that exist in the range defined by the given numbers.\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains one line, with two space separated integer numbers, $X$ and $Y$.\n-----Constraints-----\n$0 \\leq X \\leq Y < 2^{63}$\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains one line, with one number, representing the number of Sheldon numbers that are greater or equal to $X$ and less or equal to $Y$.\n-----Sample Output Explanation-----\nIn the first sample, all numbers between $1$ and $10$ are Sheldon Numbers.

One morning, the sun was shining like no other sun had ever shone before, and he wanted to do something exciting. There had been a slight storm during the night, and the wind had cleared snow from certain parts of the mountain, making them icy and more dangerous to ski down. Luk\u00e1\u0161 was aware of this, but brave as he (mostly) is, he decided that he would climb his favourite mountain and go for some really exciting skiing. \nLuk\u00e1\u0161 starts at the top of the mountain, and wants to get to the bottom. There are $N$ small cabins scattered along the mountainside, numbered $0$ to $N-1$. He will always go from one cabin to another, along certain pistes. For each piste, which always connects exactly two cabins, he has calculated the probability of falling along that piste. The cabin numbered $0$ is located at the top, and the cabin numbered $N-1$ is located at the bottom of the mountain.\nIf Luk\u00e1\u0161 feels like it, he can take his skis off and walk down a piste instead. By doing this, it is guaranteed that he will not fall along this piste in the direction that he walks. But taking the skis off is not very brave\u2026\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 can only ski down the mountain, i.e. from a lower numbered cabin to a higher numbered one, but he can walk along any piste in any direction.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:The last worker in a production line at the factory of Automated Composed Machinery is worried. She knows that her job hangs in the balance unless her productivity increases. Her work consists of assembling a set of pieces in a given sequence, but the time spent on assembling pieces $a$ and $b$ and then $c$ may not the same as that on assembling pieces $b$ and $c$, and then assembling a with the resulting component. Only two consecutive pieces may be assembled at a time, and once they are assembled they behave as another piece in terms of the time needed for further assembly.\nIn order to aid her, you need to find the optimal way to assemble all components. The input to your program will be a set of symbols representing (types of) pieces, and a so-called assembly table representing the time it takes to assemble them, as well as the type of the resulting component. For instance, we may have two symbols $\\{ a, b\\} $, and the following table:\u00a0\n$a$\n$b$\n$a$\n3-$b$\n5-$b$\n$b$\n6-$a$\n2-$b$\nThis means, for example, that two pieces of type $a$ and $a$ may assembled in $3$ minutes, and the result is a component of type $b$, in that the time required to assemble it again with another piece of, say, type $a$ is $6$ minutes, and so on. Note that the table is not symmetric, i.e., assembling $b$ and $a$ may be more time-consuming than $a$ and $b$.\nFor a sequence of components labelled $aba$, the two possible solutions are:\n - $(ab)a = ba = a$ with time $\\mathit{time}(ab) + \\mathit{time}(ba) = 5 + 6 = 11$.\n - $a(ba) = aa = b$ with time $\\mathit{time}(ba) + \\mathit{time}(aa) = 6 + 3 = 9$.\nSo the result for this case would be a piece of type $b$ in $9$ minutes (denoted 9-$b$).\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. This test case begins with a line containing a natural number $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq 26$), followed by a line with $k$ symbols (characters in $[a-z]$) separated by spaces. The following $k$ lines contain the assembly table: the $i$-th line has $k$ pairs of the form $\\mathit{time}$-$\\mathit{result}$, where $\\mathit{time}$ is an integer between $0$ and $1000000$ inclusive, and $\\mathit{result}$ a symbol belonging to the preceding set. The $j$-th pair in the $i$-th line represents the time to compose pieces of types represented by the $i$-th and $j$-th symbols, along with the type of the resulting piece. After the table, a line with an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10$) indicates the number of lines that follow, each line containing a non-empty string over the $k$ symbols. Each of these lines is a sequence of components that need to be assembled together in the right order. The sum of lengths of the $n$ lines is at most $200$.\nAfter the single test case follows a line containing 0, which should not be processed.\n-----Output-----\nPrint $n$ lines, each with an integer $\\mathit{time}$ and a symbol $\\mathit{result}$ in the format $\\mathit{time}$-$\\mathit{result}$. Each line represents the minimum time and the type of the resulting piece for the corresponding case in the input. In case of a tie among several possible results with the same minimum time, choose from among those the piece whose type letter appears first in the line that contained the $k$ symbols at the beginning of the test case.

And colon semicolon, too!\n - You Asterisk-mouth! \u2013 Sam & Max: Hit the Road \nWhen typing SMS messages on a mobile phone, each of the ten digit buttons represent several alphabetic characters. On my phone (an ancient Ericsson T65, in case anyone was wondering), I have the following mapping (1 is used for space, and 0 for some common non-alphabetic symbols):\n2 $\\rightarrow $ ABC\n3 $\\rightarrow $ DEF\n4 $\\rightarrow $ GHI\n5 $\\rightarrow $ JKL\n6 $\\rightarrow $ MNO\n7 $\\rightarrow $ PQRS\n8 $\\rightarrow $ TUV\n9 $\\rightarrow $ WXYZ\nAs you\u2019ve probably experienced, this makes the typing quite cumbersome. The phones usually try to compensate this by making use of a dictionary \u2013 basically, the idea is that there will typically be relatively few actual words having the same button combination. The way this works is that when you have typed a certain digit sequence, you can cycle through the words in the dictionary that map to this digit sequence using the \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d buttons. Pressing \u201cup\u201d gives you the next word, and pressing \u201cdown\u201d gives you the previous word. Words are ordered by how common they are, most common words first and least common words last. This wraps, so that pressing \u201cup\u201d at the last word gives you the first word and similarly for \u201cdown\u201d. Initially after having pressed a digit sequence, you will get the first (most common) word that maps to this sequence.\nThis usually works quite well, but if you\u2019re trying to type a word that does not exist in the dictionary, you have to write it by separating it into several parts, where each part is a word in the dictionary. In order to start writing a new part, you have to press the \u201cright\u201d button on the keypad.\nObviously, the number of keys needed to type a word depends on how (and if) we divide it into parts. Now, I would like to know how to type a word (that may or may not be from the dictionary) using as few key presses as possible (it\u2019s not that I\u2019m lazy, I just want to decrease the wear and tear of my keypad).\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with an integer $1 \\le N \\le 200000$ giving the size of the dictionary, followed by $N$ lines, giving the words of the dictionary from most common to least common.

This is followed by $Q$ lines, each containing a nonempty word to type. It will always be possible to type the given words using the given dictionary. The total length of all $Q$ words to type will be at most $500000$.\n-----Output-----\nFor each query, output a line containing any optimal keypress solution in the following format.\n - For pressing any of the digits 2-9, simply output that digit.\n - For pressing right, output \u2019R\u2019.\n - For pressing up or down $x > 0$ times, output \u201cU($x$)\u201d or \u201cD($x$)\u201d, respectively.\nNote that the minimum number of keypresses may be very big: it can exceed $2^{32}$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\necho\n1\nechoecho\nSample Output:\n3246R3246\n\ndef",

In other words, for every pair of stations $i$ and $j$, if $i$ and $j$ are connected by Mobi, they should not be connected by Vina, and vice versa.\nGiven $n$ and $k$, your task is to check whether it is possible for Mobi and Vina to each operates $k$ cable cars, satisfying all the above conditions.\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains two integers $n$ and $k$, separated by a single space $(1 \\le k < n \\le 100)$.\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, if it is not possible to satisfy all the conditions, print \u2018NO\u2019.

Today Bash is working on his masterpiece: \u2018The two staircases\u2019.\nThe painting is divided into a grid with $M$ rows and $N$ columns. Rows and columns are numbered starting from $1$, from bottom to top and from left to right, respectively.

More formally, Bash\u2019s picture has the following properties:\n - For every column $i$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq N)$, there exists two integers $b_{i}, r_{i}$ satisfying:\n - $0 \\leq b_{i}, 0 \\leq r_{i}, b_{i} + r_{i} \\leq M$.\n - $b_{i}$ bottommost cells (i.e, cells $(1, i), (2, i), \\ldots, (b_{i}, i)$) are blue.\n - $r_{i}$ topmost cells (i.e, cells $(M, i), (M - 1, i), \\ldots, (M - r_{i} + 1, i)$) are red.\n - All other cells are not painted.\n - $M \\geq b_{1} \\geq b_{2} \\geq \\ldots \\geq b_{N} \\geq 0$.\n - $0 \\leq r_{1} \\leq r_{2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq r_{N} \\leq M$.\nHence, Bash\u2019s picture can be uniquely determined by two sequences $b = (b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{N})$ and $r = (r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots r_{N})$.

One particular problem is lane switching\u2014if the car needs to switch lanes, it wants to do so in the safest manner.\nInitially the car is in the leftmost lane, and the car needs to switch to the rightmost lane. The car has a variety of sensors and can obtain the locations of all cars in a section of the highway. When the car needs to switch lanes, it takes a snapshot of the sensor readings and design a plan to switch lanes based on the snapshot. The sensors have limited range. All sensor readings will be distances from the start of the sensor range. For safety reason, the areas outside of the sensor range are assumed to be occupied by cars.\nYou may assume that all other cars are travelling at exactly the speed limit. However, the ACM would like to set itself apart by producing cars that may drive at any speed regardless of the speed limit, as long as it does not hit any other car. For safety reasons, a lane switch is always done while driving at the speed limit.\nWhen a lane switch occurs, the destination must have unoccupied space for the car to move into (a perfect fit is allowed). We define the safety factor of the plan as the closest distance to any car while executing the plan. We are only concerned about cars in the same lane, and will ignore distances between cars in different lanes. Obviously, the ACM wants its cars to choose a plan that has the highest safety factor.\nThe first sample input is illustrated below.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains three integers $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 100$), $M$ ($M \\geq 1$), $R$ ($1 \\leq R \\leq 1000000$) indicating the number of lanes, the number of cars on the road, and the sensor range.

It would be very hard for him to remember all passwords, so for every website he only remembers the method he used to create the password.\nFor one of the very important websites he started with a file containing a long list of non-negative integers.

Note that the operation xor is defined on boolean values as $0\\oplus 0=1\\oplus 1=0$ and $0\\oplus 1=1\\oplus 0=1$. We can then extend this definition to integers, namely we first write the two integers in binary and then do xor for each two corresponding bits in the numbers. For example the xor of $12=(1100)_2$ and $5=(101)_2$ is $9=(1001)_2$.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:You have an upcoming trip to Washington D.C. and you are fascinated with the intricacies of Congressional committee hearings. You wish to attend as many hearings as possible during your trip, and your local representative has provided you with a pass that will get you into the audience of any hearing. But there are some challenges in planning your schedule. Specifically: \n\u00a0\n - There are many committees, and thus many hearings, some of which take place at overlapping times.\n - While the committees are extremely punctual in terms of when to start a hearing, they are notoriously unpredictable in terms of how long the hearing lasts. Fortunately, rules do not actually allow for a filibuster of a committee hearing, so they cannot last forever.\n - It is considered rude to enter a hearing that is already underway, or to leave a hearing before it is complete. Given that you do not wish to embarrass the representative who provided your tickets, if you attend you must attend the entire hearing. Fortunately, hearings are very near to each other; as soon as one hearing is done, you can immediately join another hearing that is about to start.\nWell in advance of your trip, Congress publishes a schedule of hearings, indicating for each one the time\u00a0$s$ at which the hearing will start, and then values $a$ and $b$ which represent, respectively, the shortest and longest possible length of that particular hearing. You are to assume that the actual length of the hearing will be a uniformly random integer over the inclusive interval\u00a0$[a,b]$.\nYour goal is to develop a strategy that maximizes the expected number of hearings that you can attend during your trip. As an example, consider a situation in which there are four hearings with parameters as follows:\nhearing\n$s$\n$a$\n$b$\nSocial media and elections\n1\n1\n7\nNASA missions\n3\n2\n3\nOil and gas exploration\n5\n1\n4\nHurricane recovery efforts\n6\n10\n10\nFor this schedule, the optimal strategy will allow you to achieve an expected value of $2.125$ hearings. To achieve this, you begin by attending the NASA hearing, which starts at time $3$ and ends with equal probability at either time\u00a0$5$ or time\u00a0$6$ (given the hearing length that is uniformly distributed over $\\{ 2, 3\\} $). If the NASA hearing does end at time\u00a0$5$ you will immediately head to the oil and gas exploration hearing, and there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that hearing will end at time\u00a0$6$, allowing you to make yet a third hearing (about hurricane recovery efforts). If the NASA hearing instead ends at time\u00a0$6$, you will go straight to the hurricane hearing.\nBy this strategy you will attend $3$ hearings 12.5% of the time and $2$ hearings the other 87.5% of the time, and thus expected value of $2.125$. Note that if you were to start by attending the social media and elections hearing, you might optimistically make four hearings. However, a careful analysis will demonstrate that if you attend the first hearing, your optimal expected value is only $2.10714$.\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with an integer $n$ that designates the total number of scheduled hearings ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^4$). Following that are $n$ lines, each containing three integers $s$, $a$, and $b$, respectively representing the start time, minimum length, and maximum length of a hearing, such that $1 \\leq s \\leq 10^6$ and $1 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq 10^6$. The hearings will be listed in nondecreasing order of their start times.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the expected number of hearings of an optimal strategy.

The first line contains two integers $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 10^5$), which is the number of types of sweets, and $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le 10^5$), which is the number of sweets Danny has already eaten.\nThe second line contains $m$ positive integers $a_1, \\ldots, a_ m$. These numbers are proportional to $f_1, \\ldots, f_ m$, that is, $\\displaystyle f_ i = \\frac{a_ i}{\\sum _{j = 1}^m a_ j}$. It is guaranteed that the sum of all $a_ j$ is no larger than $10^5$.\nThe third line contains $k$ integers $b_1, \\ldots, b_ k$ ($1 \\le b_ i \\le m$), where each $b_ i$ denotes the type of sweet Danny bought and ate on the $i^\\text {th}$ day. It is guaranteed that every prefix of this sequence (including the whole sequence) is balanced.\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the maximum number of additional sweets that Danny can buy and eat while keeping his diet continuously balanced.

Each tram line travels from one place to another at regular intervals, always taking the same time from departure to arrival. It is very easy to change trams, and we assume that it takes no time to change to another tram if both are at a stop at the same time.

One of her friends suggested a long list of applications (more commonly known as \u201capps\u201d) that she should install on the phone. Sandra immediately started installing the apps from the list, but after installing a few, the phone did not have enough disk space to install any more apps. Sometimes, the app installation failed because there was not even enough space to download the installation package. Other apps could be downloaded just fine, but had insufficient space to store the installed app. \nEach app that Sandra installs has a download size $d$ and a storage size $s$. To download the app, Sandra\u2019s phone must have at least $d$ megabytes of free disk space. After the app has been installed, it then uses $s$ megabytes of disk space on the phone. The download size may be smaller than the storage size (e.g., if the app data is heavily compressed) or larger than the storage size (e.g., if the download contains material that might not get used such as translations to different languages). The installer is very efficient and can transform the downloaded package to an installed app without using any extra disk space. Thus, to install an app, the phone must have at least $\\max (d, s)$ megabytes of free disk space.\nSandra quickly realised that she may have run out of space just because she installed apps in the wrong order. Thus, she decided to give the installation another try. She uninstalled all apps, and will now choose an installation order that lets her install the largest number of apps from the list. Sandra may not install any app more than once.\nHelp her determine what apps on the list she should install, and in what order.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line with two integers $n$, $c$ ($1 \\le n \\le 500, 1 \\le c \\le 10000$), the number of available apps and the available disk space of the phone in megabytes.\n - $n$ lines, each with two integers $d, s$ ($1 \\le d, s \\le 10000$), the download size and storage size of an app, in megabytes.\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line with the maximum number of apps that can be installed.

In particular, the contest cannot be held on the Friday before Canadian Thanksgiving; that date is sacred. A list of additional \u201cforbidden dates\u201d is provided, but every year there is at least one Friday in October when the contest can be held.\nNot all contest schedules are equally good. People tend to expect the contest to be held on or near the date it was held in the previous year. For example, they don\u2019t like to be surprised when they expect a date in early October but the contest runs late in the month, etc. There is a yearly \u201csurprise penalty\u201d for holding the contest on October $X$ one year when it had been on October $Y$ the year before, namely $(X-Y)^2$, which penalizes big surprises much more than little ones.\nYour goal is to find a schedule for the $Z$ years following $2018$ such that the total of the yearly surprise penalties is as small as possible.Useful facts:\n - Canadian Thanksgiving is always the second Monday in October.\n - January\u00a0$1$, $2019$, is a Tuesday.\n - Years have $365$ days, except leap years, which have an extra day in February.\n - From $2018$ until the year $2400$ (exclusive), a leap year is any year divisible by $4$ but not divisible by $100$.\n - January\u00a0$1$ is the $1^{\\textrm{st}}$ day of the year, and October\u00a0$1$ is the $274^{\\textrm{th}}$ day of $2018$.\n - October has $31$ days.\n - The contest was held on October $12$, $2018$.\n-----Input-----\n - The first line of the input is the integer $Z$ $(1 \\leq Z \\leq 100)$, the number of years following $2018$ for which the contest is to be scheduled.\n - The second line contains an integer $F$ $(0 \\leq F \\leq 50)$, the number of forbidden dates.\n - The following $F$ lines contain the forbidden dates, one per line.

One of the more famous rounds is the nursery rhyme \"Row, Row, Your Boat\", shown here. \n\u00a0\nIn western music, an integer count of time units can be assigned to each syllable to indicate how long that syllable is sung. A rest of one or more time units can be treated as a syllable that simply isn\u2019t sung. If you know the time allocated to each syllable, and the time offset at which a second voice begins singing the song, you can determine which words will overlap in the round.\nYou are to write a program to display a two-voice round so that syllables that are sung simultaneously in the two voices appear vertically aligned. For each line of the original input, there are to be two lines of output: one for the original line sung by the first voice and one to display syllables (if any) that are started by the second voice during the time period where the first voice is singing the indicated line. Syllables for each voice in the output must be separated by one or more underscores (\u2019_\u2019), with each syllable displayed as far to the left as possible, subject to the following constraints:\nConsecutive syllables on a line are separated by at least one \u2019_\u2019 character.\nTwo syllables that begin at the same time in their respective voices are displayed with their leftmost characters in the same column.\nConsider syllables S1 and S2, either sung by the same or different voices, that are displayed within the same pair of output lines.

For each such interval, the first few days come at a pretty high price per day, the next few days come at a slightly lower price per day, and so on. \nSince you miss your friends back home, you will frequently be going home for a few days. On the one hand, it seems wasteful to pay for keeping the transit card charged during the days you are away. But on the other hand, if you do not keep it charged then you have to start a new date interval when you get back and will be forced to pay the higher price for a few days again.\nGiven the pricing scheme and the schedule of which days you are going to be away, you decide to write a program to help you determine the cheapest option.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $1 \\le l \\le 100$, the number of price levels for the transit card.

MTA used to sell them individually, but now has decided to adopt a new business strategy that involves randomly choosing $4$ figurines from the entire collection to be packaged and sold together as a \u2018$4$-pack\u2019. Each figurine in a $4$-pack is chosen independently and randomly with uniform distribution. As such, it is possible that a $4$-pack may contain multiple copies of a particular figurine.\nEven though some figurines may be more valuable than others, every randomly assembled $4$-pack is sold at the same price. Customers buying a $4$-pack of figurines do not know ahead of time which figurines will be inside, and so it is a matter of chance whether they get the figurines that they want most. While the price is the same across all $4$-packs, the weight is not, as each figurine has a distinct integer weight in grams.\nBefore MTA releases its new line of figurines, its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would like an executive summary with information about the proposed $4$-packs. Specifically, the CFO wants to know: the greatest possible weight of a $4$-pack, the smallest possible weight of a $4$-pack, the number of distinct weights that a $4$-pack could have, and the expected weight of a $4$-pack. Note that the expected weight is the average (mean) weight across all possible distinct $4$-packs, where two $4$-packs are distinct if and only if one $4$-pack has a different number of figurines of any particular weight than the other $4$-pack. So, for example, a $4$-pack with weights $\\{ 2,2,3,5\\} $ is distinct from a $4$-pack with weights $\\{ 2,3,3,4\\} $ (even though they both have the same total weight). Also, a $4$-pack with weights $\\{ 2,2,3,5\\} $ is distinct from a 4-pack with weights $\\{ 2,3,3,5\\} $.\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$, the number of different figurines to be produced, where $1\\leq N\\leq 40000$. The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers representing the weight in grams of each of the figurines. Each weight, $k$, is an integer satisfying $1\\leq k\\leq 60000$, and all $N$ weights are distinct.\n-----Output-----\nThe output should consist of a single line with $4$ space-separated values. The first value should be an integer, the maximum weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines. The second value should be an integer, the minimum weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines. The third value should be an integer, the number of distinct weights that the $4$-packs can have for the given set of figurines. The fourth value should be a floating-point value, the expected weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines, with an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-4}$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1 2 4 7\nSample Output:\n28 4 21 14.0\n\ndef",

Whenever they see a puzzle like Sudoku, they cannot stop themselves from solving it. The objective of Sudoku is to fill a $9\\times 9$ grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine ($3\\times 3$) subgrids that compose the grid (also called \u201cboxes\u201d, \u201cblocks\u201d, or \u201cregions\u201d) contains all of the digits from $1$ to $9$. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.\nAfter many years of solving Sudoku problems, Alice and Bob are tired of Sudoku. They have been trying to develop a harder variation of Sudoku, which they are calling Superdoku. In Superdoku, the grid is bigger \u2013 $n\\times n$ instead of just $9\\times 9$. However, the \u201cblock\u201d constraints are impossible to formulate when there are no further constraints on $n$. Therefore, there are no block constraints in Superdoku. Instead, the goal is simply to make sure that each column and each row in the grid contains all of the integers from $1$ to $n$. After playing for a while in the standard way (where any of the grid cells may have previously been filled in), they decide that the game is too difficult and they want to simplify it. Therefore, they decide to make the initial grid further constrained. They constrain the board by filling in the first $k$ rows completely.\nAlice and Bob both believe that Superdoku is solvable. However, since $n$ could be very big, it may still take a long time to figure out a solution. They don\u2019t want to spend too much time on this single game, so they are asking for your help!\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line lists two space-separated integers $1 \\le n \\le 100$ and $0 \\le k \\le n$, denoting the size of the grid $(n\\times n)$ and the number of rows $k$ that are already filled in. Each of the following $k$ lines contains $n$ space-separated integers, denoting the first $k$ given rows. All integers in these $k$ lines are between $1$ and $n$.\n-----Output-----\nOutput either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on the first line, indicating if there is a solution. If there is no solution, do not output anything more. If there is a solution, output $n$ more lines, each containing $n$ space-separated integers, representing a solution.

Their latest invention is a fast-paced game of chance called Stop Counting!, where a single customer plays with a dealer who has a deck of cards. Each card has some integer value.\nOne by one, the dealer reveals the cards in the deck in order, and keeps track of the sum of the played cards and the number of cards shown. At some point before a card is dealt, the player can call \u201cStop Counting!\u201d After this, the dealer continues displaying cards in order, but does not include them in the running sums. At some point after calling \u201cStop Counting!\u201d, and just before another card is dealt, the player can also call \u201cStart Counting!\u201d and the dealer then includes subsequent cards in the totals. The player can only call \u201cStop Counting!\u201d and \u201cStart Counting!\u201d at most once each, and they must call \u201cStop Counting!\u201d before they can call \u201cStart Counting!\u201d. A card is \u201ccounted\u201d if it is dealt before the player calls \u201cStop Counting!\u201d or is dealt after the player calls \u201cStart Counting!\u201d\nThe payout of the game is then the average value of the counted cards. That is, it is the sum of the counted cards divided by the number of counted cards. If there are no counted cards, the payout is $0$.\nYou have an \u2018in\u2019 with the dealer, and you know the full deck in order ahead of time.

The value of each card is in the range $[-10^{9}, 10^{9}]$. The cards are dealt in the same order they are given in the input.\n-----Output-----\nOutput the largest attainable payout. The answer is considered correct if the absolute error is less than $10^{-6}$, or the relative error is less than $10^{-9}$.\n-----Sample Explanation-----\nIn the first sample, by calling \u201cStop Counting!\u201d before the $-10$ and \u201cStart Counting!\u201d before the final $10$, we can achieve an average of $10.0$ with the cards that are counted.\nIn the second sample, all values are negative, so the best strategy is to call \u201cStop Counting!\u201d before the first card is dealt and call \u201cStart Counting!\u201d after the last card is dealt. Since no cards were counted, the average of the counted cards is $0.0$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5\n10 10 -10 -4 10\nSample Output:\n10.000000000\n\ndef",

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Two years ago, you helped install the nation\u2019s very first Flubber pipe network in your hometown, to great success. Polls show that everyone loves having their own Flubber dispenser in their kitchen, and now a few enterprising citizens have discovered a use for it. Apparently Flubber, when mixed with water, can help extinguish fires! This is a very timely discovery, as out-of-control fires have lately been surprisingly common.\nYour hometown\u2019s city council would like to make use of this property of Flubber by creating the Flubber/water mixture at a centrally located station. This station, which is called the Flubber Department (FD) will also have specialized employees trained to travel to the locations of fires and make use of their processed Flubber to control the blazes.\nThe pipes are already in place all around the city. You are given a layout of the pipes, and must determine how to route Flubber from the Flubber factory and water from a local source through the pipes to the FD.\nNote that both Flubber and water will be flowing through the same network of pipes, perhaps even the same pipe. All pipes are bidirectional, but Flubber and water cannot move in opposite directions through the same pipe. Furthermore, if both liquids are sent in the same direction through the same pipe, they will inevitably mix. Therefore the nodes in the network have been equipped with special membranes and filters that enable you to separate and reorganize all incoming mixtures as you see fit. The network is a closed system, so the total rate of each fluid going into a node must equal the total rate of that fluid going out, except at the source of that fluid and the destination (the FD).\nEach pipe has a certain capacity. Flubber, being somewhat sluggish, has a viscosity value $v$, so a pipe that can transport $v$ liters/second of water can transport only $1$ liter/second of Flubber. The pipe\u2019s capacity scales linearly for mixtures of the two. To be precise, if $c$ denotes the water capacity of the pipe and $f$ and $w$ are the rates of Flubber and water moving through the pipe (all measured in liters/second), then the capacity constraint is given by the inequality $v\\cdot f + w \\leq c$.\nYour main concern is balancing the mixture that reaches the FD. You would like as much total liquid as possible, but you also need a sufficient amount of water \u2013 because undiluted Flubber is highly flammable \u2013 and a sufficient amount of Flubber \u2013 because it would not be much of a \u201cFlubber Department\u201d without Flubber! You have come up with a formula to measure the \u201cvalue\u201d of the final mixture: $F^a \\cdot W^{1-a}$, where $F$ is the rate of incoming Flubber in liters/second, $W$ is the rate of incoming water in liters/second, and $a$ is a given constant between $0$ and $1$.\nDetermine the maximum value of $F^a \\cdot W^{1-a}$ that can be achieved and how to route the Flubber and water to achieve it.\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with a line containing the number of locations $n$ ($3 \\leq n \\leq 200$), the number of pipes $p$ ($n-1 \\leq p \\leq \\tfrac {1}{2}n(n-1)$), and the real values $v$ ($1 \\leq v \\leq 10$) and $a$ ($0.01 \\leq a \\leq 0.99$). Locations are numbered from $1$ to $n$; $1$ is the Flubber factory, $2$ is the water source, and $3$ is the FD. The real values have at most $10$ digits after the decimal point.\nThe following $p$ lines each describe one pipe. Each line contains two integers $j$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq j < k \\leq n$), giving the locations connected by the pipe, and an integer $c$ ($1 \\leq c \\leq 10$), giving the water capacity of the pipe in liters/second.\nNo two pipes connect the same pair of locations. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that the network is connected.\n-----Output-----\nFirst, for each pipe (in the order given in the input), display two values: the rate of Flubber moving through it, and the rate of water moving through it (negative if the liquid is moving from $k$ to $j$), such that $F^a \\cdot W^{1-a}$ is maximized. Then display that maximum value accurate to within an absolute error of $10^{-4}$.\nIf there are multiple solutions, any one will be accepted. All constraints (not sending Flubber and water in opposite directions along the same pipe, flow conservation, pipe capacities, and consistency between the constructed solution and its claimed value) must be satisfied within an absolute error of $10^{-4}$.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n6 6 3.0 0.66\n2 4 8\n4 6 1\n3 6 1\n4 5 5\n1 5 7\n3 5 3\nSample Output:\n0.000000000 1.360000000\n0.000000000 1.000000000\n0.000000000 -1.000000000\n0.000000000 0.360000000\n0.880000000 0.000000000\n-0.880000000 -0.360000000\n1.02037965897\n\ndef",

The only way to manipulate the staircases is by pressing red and green buttons located on each floor. The floors are labeled in some manner by the integers $0$ through $N-1$. Pressing the red button on floor $i$ ($0\\leq i \\leq N-1$) has the following effect on the staircases. Any staircase that is currently not connected to floor $i$ does not move. Suppose a staircase connects floors $i$ and $j$ ($j \\neq i$). After pressing the red button on floor $i$, it will instead connect floors $i$ and $j+1 \\bmod N$ \u2013 unless $j+1\\bmod N = i$, in which case it will connect floors $i$ and $j+2 \\bmod N =i+1 \\bmod N$ instead. Pressing the green button is simply the inverse operation of pressing the red one on the same floor (or, equivalently, the same as pressing the red one $N-2$ times).\nWhile alone, the staircases got all messed up. The school adminstrators have presented a plan for how they would rather like the staircases to be placed.\nYou, a low-ranking house elf, have been given the task to fix this.\n-----Task-----\nFind some sequence of at most $250000$ button presses that will change the staircase room from its current state to the desired state.\n-----Input-----\nThere is a single test case. On the first line $N$ and $M$ are given ($3 \\leq N \\leq 50$, $0 \\leq M \\leq N(N-1)/2$).\nThen follow $M$ lines with pairs of integers $i$, $j$ ($0 \\leq i,j\\leq N-1$), describing the current state of the room of staircases. Each such line means that there is a staircase connecting floors $i$ and $j$. After this follow another $M$ lines with pairs of integers $i$, $j$, describing the desired state of the room of staircases.\nYou may assume that neither the current state of the room nor the desired state of the room contains two staircases between the same pairs of floors (but some pairs of floors may appear in both the current and desired states of the room).\n-----Output-----\nOn the first line of output, write a single integer $Q$ ($0 \\le Q \\le 250000$), the length of your sequence of button presses. Then print $Q$ lines, each being either \u201cR $i$\u201d or \u201cG $i$\u201d for some $i$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq N-1$), meaning that the red or green button on floor $i$ should be pressed.\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 4\n0 1\n0 3\n1 2\n2 4\n0 2\n0 4\n2 3\n2 4\nSample Output:\n2\nR 0\nG 2\n\ndef",

Each supplier of raw materials and each factory resides in one of Acmania\u2019s states. No state has both a factory and a supplier (and never more than one of either) and there are arcane laws governing which transportation companies can transport materials across state lines. Because of the fierce competition between factories and between suppliers each transportation company handles the output of at most one raw material site and delivers to at most one factory (or to another transportation company). Each supplier can produce enough material to contract with at most one factory and no factory will contract with more than one supplier. Your job is to determine the maximum number of factories that can be supplied with raw materials.\nFor example, suppose that there are three suppliers in states A, B and C, and three factories in states D, E and F. Let\u2019s say you contract three transportation firms: firm $1$ can transport between states A, E and G; firm $2$ can transport between states A, C and E; and firm $3$ can transport between states B, D and F. In this case, you can supply at most two factories (for example, factory E can be supplied from supplier A using firm $1$, and factory F can be supplied from supplier B using firm $3$). If you find a fourth firm that transports between states G and F then you can supply all three factories: factory D can be supplied from B using firm $3$, factory E can be supplied from C using firm $2$, and factory F can be supplied from A using firms $1$ and $4$.\n-----Input-----\nThe input will start with four positive integers $s$ $r$ $f$ $t$ indicating the number of states, raw material sites, factories and transportation companies, where $1 \\leq r,f \\leq 200$, $r+f \\leq s \\leq 600$ and $1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$.\nNext will follow a line containing $r$ state names, one for each raw material site.\nThe next line will contain $f$ state names, one for each factory site.\nFinally there will be $t$ lines, one for each transportation company. Each of these lines will start with an integer $n$, $1 \\leq n \\leq s$, indicating the number of states the company is allowed to work in, followed by $n$ state names.

In the method, a laser charge is fired at the atom, which then releases energy in a process formally called explodification. Exactly how this process proceeds depends on the number of neutrons $k$:\n - If the atom contains $k \\leq n$ neutrons, it will be converted into $a_ k$ joules of energy.\n - If the atom contains $k > n$ neutrons, it will decompose into two atoms with $i$ and $j$ neutrons respectively, satisfying $i,j \\geq 1$ and $i+j=k$.

        "prompt": "Complete the Python function given the prompt below:Real-time software in the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft suffered from an issue known as priority inversion. One technique to address this issue is to use the Priority Ceiling Protocol.\nIn this problem, you will simulate the execution of multiple tasks according to this protocol. The tasks share a collection of resources, each of which can be used by only one task at a time. To ensure this, resources must be locked before use and unlocked after use. Each task is defined by a start time, a unique base priority, and a sequence of instructions. Each task also has a current priority, which may change during execution. Instructions come in three types:\n - compute \u2013 perform a computation for one\u00a0microsecond\n - lock $k$ \u2013 lock resource $k$ (which takes no processor time)\n - unlock $k$ \u2013 unlock resource $k$ (which takes no processor time)\nAfter locking a resource, a task is said to own the resource until the task unlocks it. A task will unlock only the owned resource it most recently locked, will not lock a resource it already owns, and will complete with no owned resources.\nEach resource has a fixed priority ceiling, which is the highest base priority of any task that contains an instruction to lock that resource.\nThere is a single processor that executes the tasks. When the processor starts, it initializes its clock to zero and then runs an infinite loop with the following steps:Step 1.\nIdentify running tasks. A task is running if its start time is less than or equal to the current processor clock and not all of its instructions have been executed.Step 2.\nDetermine the current priorities of the running tasks and which of the running tasks are blocked. A running task $T$ is blocked if the next instruction in $T$ is to lock resource\u00a0$k$ and either resource\u00a0$k$ is already owned or at least one other task owns a resource\u00a0$\\ell $ whose priority ceiling is greater than or equal to the current priority of $T$. If $T$ is blocked, it is said to be blocked by every task owning such $k$ or $\\ell $. The current priority of a task $T$ is the maximum of $T$\u2019s base priority and the current priorities of all tasks that $T$ blocks.Step 3.\nExecute the next instruction of the non-blocked running task (if any) with the highest current priority. If there was no such task or if a compute instruction was executed, increment the processor clock by one\u00a0microsecond. If a lock or unlock instruction was executed, do not increment the clock.\nThe Priority Ceiling Protocol defined above has the following properties:\n - Current priority is defined in terms of current priority and blocking, and blocking is defined in terms of current priority. While this may appear circular, there will always be a unique set of current priorities that satisfy the definitions.\n - All tasks will eventually complete.\n - There will never be a tie in step\u00a03.\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $t$ $(1 \\leq t \\leq 20)$, which is the number of tasks, and $r$ ($1 \\leq r \\leq 20$), which is the number of resources.

The description of a task begins with three integers: the task\u2019s start time $s$ ($1 \\leq s \\leq 10000$), its base priority $b$ ($1 \\leq b \\leq t$), and an integer $a$ ($1 \\leq a \\leq 100$). A task description is concluded by a sequence of $a$ strings describing the instructions. Each string is a letter (C or L or U) followed by an integer.
